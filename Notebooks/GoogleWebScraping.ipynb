Rechargeable batteries and lithium-ion batteries are hazardous and could produce sparks that may start a fire in the trucks or recycling facility. This includes batteries in laptops, mobile phones, power tools and cameras. Place sticky tape around battery terminals to prevent fires (scroll down for more information). \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                         \\r\\n                             \\r\\n                                 \\r\\n                             \\r\\n                         \\r\\n                      \\r\\n     \\r\\n         \\r\\n             \\r\\n                 \\r\\n                 \\r\\n             \\r\\n         \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   Batteries \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t \\r\\n\\t\\t \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n     \\r\\n         material \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n     Find a recycler \\r\\n     \\r\\n         \\r\\n         \\r\\n     \\r\\n    \\r\\n         \\r\\n             Are you a business?

This program has partnered with approximately 100 organisations across Australia to provide recycling drop-off points for the public. \\r\\n Aldi \\xa0supermarkets offer a free battery recycling service at all their Australian stores. Any brand of AA, AAA, C, D and 9V batteries (both rechargeable and non-rechargeable) are accepted. Simply drop your used batteries into the dedicated bins in store. For other services and for options for different battery types (e.g. buttons and 12 volts) see below. \\r\\n Woolworths \\xa0supermarkets have battery and mobile phone collection points in store. \\r\\n  is in the process of rolling out a national   service in its stores. Single-use and rechargeable batteries in AA, AAA, C, D, 9V, as well as laptop and mobile phone batteries are accepted. \\r\\n Battery World  has a recycling program with collection points at most stores (some stores in WA do not accept batteries for recycling). Check with your local store to find out which types of batteries are accepted.\\xa0 \\r\\n \\r\\n Even dead batteries have some residual charge, so it is very important to place sticky tape around the battery ‘terminal’ before recycling them. A battery terminal is the electrical connection point of the battery. They are located in different areas depending on the type of battery (at both ends of regular batteries, for example). To learn more about how to tape and safely store batteries, visit  B-cycle . \\r\\n HOW TO RECYCLE BATTERIES AT WORK \\r\\n Workplaces and businesses can register for a safe and secure recycling collection box through  . The program includes a pick-up service when the box is full. \\r\\n Your workplace can also search   for recycling options including drop-off and pick-up services. \\r\\n WHY SHOULD I RECYCLE MY BATTERIES? \\r\\n There are a wide range of battery types, many of which contain toxic metals such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Others contain valuable materials like magnesium and zinc. \\r\\n Recycling batteries keeps toxic materials out of landfill where they can contaminate the soil and groundwater. It also ensures the valuable materials in batteries are recycled into the something new, which reduces the amount of finite natural resources used in the production of new batteries. \\r\\n WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BATTERIES WHEN I RECYCLE THEM? \\r\\n Batteries that are recycled are processed to recover the plastics and metals, some of which are used to manufacture new batteries. \\r\\n Envirostream , Australia’s first onshore lithium, nickel metal and alkaline battery processor, is able to recover 95% of the materials in the batteries for recycling. Any steel, copper and aluminium recovered is returned to the manufacturing sector for recycling, while the active components of lithium-ion batteries (including graphite, cobalt, nickel and lithium) are used to produce a valuable product called mixed metal dust, which is used to produce new lithium-ion batteries. \\r\\n DIFFERENT KINDS OF BATTERIES \\r\\n Single-use batteries are usually alkaline batteries with zinc, manganese or lithium chemistry. Rechargeable batteries are commonly nickel cadmium, nickel metal hydride or lithium-ion. Rechargeable batteries are found in the same shapes and voltage as single-use batteries, as well as specifically designed for laptops, mobile phones and electronic equipment. \\r\\n Buying rechargeable batteries is a great way to reduce battery waste. Each battery can be recharged up to 1000 times, saving you money and reducing pollution from discarded batteries.

Research to date has demonstrated a variety of electrolyte chemistries and processing methods toward commercialization. However, the sustainability of these materials is not well studied, with just a few recent works addressing recycling concepts of sulfide-based solid electrolytes. Fortunately, the current state of research into ASSB fabrication and LIB regeneration methods demonstrate viable concepts that can potentially be applied toward ASSB recycling. In particular, a combined approach of hydrometallurgical and direct recycling methods may have the highest potential toward viable ASSB recycling while addressing chemical stability and processing safety concerns. Summary All solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are expected to be the future for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, recycling aspects for ASSBs are underexplored and would be critical as supply/demand projections will eventually result in unprecedented amounts of disposed LIBs, especially from the automotive sector. The current state of LIB recycling is inadequate, and the incorporation of lithium-metal anodes and solid electrolyte chemistries in ASSBs will pose additional challenges. Therefore, recycling viability and waste management should have a guiding role in ASSB development toward commercialization. In this work, we touch upon the leading solid-state electrolyte chemistries, differences between ASSBs and conventional LIBs from a recycling aspect, and the viability of various recycling processes with respect to ASSBs. We further propose a general design for ASSB recycling, utilizing hydrometallurgy and direct recycling methods. Finally, we discuss the value of legislation and automation toward the realization of large-scale ASSB recycling, and future directions of study.

Introduction\\nRenewable energy sources have the potential to end the era of fossil fuels. Electrochemical storage\\nsystems , especially lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), are an important technology for the success of\\nthis transition. This is due to their sum of positive properties such as their high energy density and low\\nself-discharge [ 1]. On the production site, the growing application of LIBs leads to high investments in\\nresearch and development with a focus on questions such as optimized cell production or optimized\\nactive materials. These developments are accompanied by a critical discussion regarding the security of\\nthe necessary raw material supply, the environmental and social impact of the raw material production,\\nand the responsible recycling of end-of-life batteries [ 2–5]. Beside base metals such as iron (Fe),\\naluminum (Al), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and nickel (Ni), LIBs also contain minor metals such\\nas cobalt (Co) and lithium (Li) as well as graphite. The production of some of these raw materials\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107; doi:10.3390 /met10081107 www.mdpi.com /journal /metals\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 2 of 29\\ncan be connected to severe ecological and social impacts. Examples are the appearance of child labor\\nin artisanal Co mining and the inﬂuence of Li production on the water balance in desert areas [ 6,7].\\nFurthermore, in the case of some raw materials, a small number of producers dominate the markets.\\nThis is especially true for Co and graphite [ 8]. In view of these developments, the recycling of LIBs\\nis a key factor to manage the transition toward renewable energies in a sustainable way. However,\\nLIB recycling is a challenging task due to their complex material composition and their electrical and\\nchemical energy content leading to various health, safety, and environmental (HSE) risks [9].\\nIn order to ensure a closed loop for LIBs (see Figure 1), extensive research activities started about\\n15 years ago. Several e \\x0borts led to the development of di \\x0berent recycling processes, which have been\\nrealized in a few pioneering industrial plants. All these process routes are characterized by long and\\ncomplex process chains and use a combination of mechanical and /or thermal and /or pyrometallurgical\\nand hydrometallurgical unit operations [10].\\nMetals 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 31 \\n Examples are the appearance of child labor in artisanal Co mining and the influence of Li production on the water balance in desert areas [6,7].

Closed loop for battery materials. \\nThis paper reviews and discusses the current status  of industrial metallurgical processes from a European perspective. In contrast to existing reviews [11–17], which often focus on research at a lower technology readiness level and specific process te chnologies, this review emphasizes the complex dependencies between legal framework, economic co nditions, and technical boundaries of industrial process routes. The focus here lays on the meta l extraction and metal refining from battery cells/modules. Pre-treatment (discharging and dismantling of battery systems) is not covered in this review. For further details on this subject, see [10,11]. Products of metal refining are metal salts, compounds, or the respective metals, e.g., cathodes that can be used in different industries depending on the final quality. In the following, after a background on current and future LIBs as well as legislation is given in Section 2, the currently pursued industrial recycling routes are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the recycling processes are critically discussed with respect to legislation, recovery rate, process robustness, economics, and HSE. Section 5 summari zes the main conclusions and gives an outlook regarding the upcoming developments.  2.

Current Lithium-Ion Battery Composition\\nIn this section, the main battery cell components, cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator of\\ncurrent LIBs are presented, since these components have the biggest inﬂuence on the recycling processes.\\n2.1.1. Positive Electrode (Cathode)\\nThe positive electrode consists of the active material, which is coated on the current collector foil,\\nusually Al. In most cases, as binder, polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) with the addition of carbons as\\nconducting agents is used. The active material must be able to deintercalate Li ions and oxidize the\\ntransition metals for charge balance [ 1]. There are three di \\x0berent types of cathode active materials:\\nlayered oxides (LiMO 2with M =Co, Ni, Mn, Al), spinels (LiM 2O4with M =Mn, Ni), and phosphates\\n(LiMPO 4with M =Fe, Mn, Co, Ni). Commercially available active materials are presented in Table 3.\\nTable 3. Summary of the properties of the main commercially available cathode active materials\\n[1,23–25].\\nCathode Active MaterialReversible Capacity\\n[Ah /Kg]Speciﬁc Energy\\n[Wh /Kg]Advantage Disadvantage\\nLCO (LiCoO 2) 150 624 speciﬁc energy safety, stability and costs\\nNMC (LiNi xMn yCo zO2) 160–200 592–740 reversible capacity capacity fade\\nNCA (LiNi 0.8Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O2) 200 740 stability safety, costs\\nLMO (LiMn 2O4) 120 410 costs stability\\nLFP (LiFePO 4) 160 544 costs, safety speciﬁc energy\\nIn most markets, layered oxides are the foremost commercially used cathode active materials,\\nespecially in traction batteries [ 25]. For optimized speciﬁc and reversible capacity compared to\\nNMC 1:1:1 and a higher thermal stability compared to NCA, the Ni-content of NMC is currently\\nmaximized from 1:1:1 to Ni-rich compositions up to 8:1:1 [ 25–27]. In contrast, particularly in China,\\nLiFePO 4(LFP)-based batteries have been widely used in buses and xEVs, which means that in China,\\nsigniﬁcant return ﬂows of this battery chemistry have to be expected [10].\\n2.1.2. Negative Electrode (Anode)\\nOn the anodic side of the battery, the current collector foil consists of Cu and the active material\\nis graphite in most cases. Typically, as binder, styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR) in combination\\nwith the polymeric thickener carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carbons as conducting agents is\\nused [ 28]. Consumer applications usually use natural graphite because of the satisfactory properties\\nat an acceptable price. For high-energy or high-power applications, artiﬁcial graphite is used [ 1,25].\\nTo combine the beneﬁts of both, a combination is possible as well. A limited but increasing number of\\ncell producers include small fractions of about 5% silicon (Si) or SiO 2to increase cell energy in their\\nanode active material [ 25,29]. Furthermore, lithium titanate (LTO) is applied as anode active material\\nin high-power applications. In this case, Al is used as a current collector foil instead of Cu [30].\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 5 of 29\\nArtiﬁcial and natural graphite have a market share of 89% while amorphous carbon has a share\\nof 7%, which is in total a 96% market share of solely carbon-based anodic materials. C /Sixcomposites\\nand LTO share the remaining 4% market share equally [25].\\n2.1.3. Electrolyte and Separator\\nThis section shortly summarizes the typically used electrolytes and separators. Electrolytes consist\\nof the conducting salt, solvents, and additives. They need to provide high and stable conductivity\\nand a manageable safety level. As electrolyte solvents carbonates, esters as well as ethers are used\\ncommercially. State of the art are mixtures of cyclic carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC)\\nor propylene carbonate (PC) with open chained carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC),\\nethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), and /or diethyl carbonate (DEC). Usually, these mixtures strongly\\ndepend on the application of the battery [ 1]. Currently, new solvent components, that could for\\nexample substitute EC, are evaluated [29].\\nThe conducting salt in all commercially available batteries is lithium hexaﬂuorophosphate (LiPF 6).\\nOther possible conducting salts are lithium bis(triﬂuormethyl)sulfonylimid (LiTFSI) and its derivates\\n(e.g., lithium bis(ﬂuorosulfonyl) imide (LiFSI)) or lithium [tris(pentaﬂuorethyl)-triﬂuorphosphate]\\n(LiFAP), lithium 4,5-dicyano-2-triﬂuoromethyl-imidazolide (LiTDI), and lithium bis(oxalate)borate\\n(LiBOB) [1,29,31]. LiFSI and LiTDI are already commercially available [32].\\nSeparators divide the space between the electrodes and are only permeable for ions. Four di \\x0berent\\nseparator types are existent: microporous membranes, ceramic-coated separators, non-woven mats,\\nand solid inorganic and polymeric electrolytes. Polyoleﬁn-based membranes currently dominate the\\nmarket for separators [ 1,25]. Currently, coated separators (e.g., with PVDF or ceramics) experience\\nincreased application [26,32].\\n2.2. Future Lithium-Ion Battery Composition\\nFor e \\x0bective planning of recycling plants, knowledge about possible developments in the\\nLIB technology is crucial. Consequently, this section presents the main possible future chemical\\ncompositions of LIB cells.\\n2.2.1. Positive Electrode (Cathode)\\nA short-term goal is to further improve NMC materials. Especially, the formation of spherical\\nNMC particles that have a Ni-rich core for high capacity and a Mn-rich shell for stability seems\\ninteresting [ 27]. In addition, currently, a growing interest in LFP chemistries can be observed due to\\ntheir low raw material costs and intrinsic safety [ 21]. Li- and Mn-rich oxides are discussed in research\\nbecause of their high theoretical speciﬁc capacity and low costs. However, they are considered a\\nmedium- to long-term development because of the need for a di \\x0berent electrolyte system [ 27,33,34]\\nalso mentioned possible positive e \\x0bects of doping or coating active material particles, which can also be\\nconsidered a long-term optimization approach. Doping can promote high speciﬁc capacity and good\\nlong-term stability, which are two properties that usually do not appear together. Possible dopants\\nare cations such as Ag+, Al3+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Mo6+, Ru2+, Ti4+and Zr4+, as well as anions such\\nas F–. Coatings such as Al 2O3, AlPO 4, AlF 3, PrPO 4, TiO 2, and V 2O5are also discussed, especially for\\nprotection measures of the particles against components of the electrolyte [27,33].\\n2.2.2. Negative Electrode (Anode)\\nAnode active materials with larger Si fractions of up to 40% or the use of tin (Sn) over Si are\\nin discussion [ 35]. Li metal is a promising anode active material in the medium term, especially for\\nall-solid-state batteries [1,25,29].\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 6 of 29\\n2.2.3. Electrolyte and Separator\\nThe application of standard electrolyte systems with LiPF 6will continue in the upcoming years.\\nAccording to [25], even high voltage cathode materials are suitable for that system. Solid electrolytes\\nthat combine the functions of the separator and the electrolyte may gain importance in the long term. It is\\nstill unclear if the advantages of solid electrolytes are strong enough compared to already commercially\\nfunctioning separators, since major technological breakthroughs are pending [25].\\n2.3. Legislative Framework\\nThe recycling of batteries in Europe is regulated in the Batteries Directive (2006 /66/EG) [ 36]. It came\\ninto force in 2006 and is implemented in national laws by each member of the EU. In terms of LIB\\nrecycling, the producer carries an extended responsibility and must bear the cost of collecting, treating,\\nand recycling. Furthermore, the directive requires a minimum recycling e \\x0eciency. All collected and\\nidentiﬁable spent batteries must be treated and recycled according to the state of the art. For LIBs,\\na recycling e \\x0eciency of at least 50% by weight must be achieved. Since 2006, the directive has been\\namended several times, most recently in 2013 [37].\\nThe Batteries Directive is currently under major revision, and the presentation of a draft version\\nof the new directive is expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 [ 38]. Although details have not been\\npublished yet, increasing collection targets for consumer batteries, the introduction of element-speciﬁc\\nrecycling quotas for Li, Co, and Ni, more speciﬁc regulations for traction batteries, as well as uniform\\nregulations for the calculation of recycling quotas are expected by most stakeholders. In China,\\nsimilar regulations, especially regarding element-speciﬁc recycling targets, are in force [39,40].\\n3. Process Chains for the Recycling of Lithium-Ion Batteries\\nSection 2 described the current composition of LIBs and possible future developments. From a\\nrecycling point of view, the main challenges derive, on the one hand, from the complex material\\ncomposition including halogenic and organic compounds as well as the high energy content and, on the\\nother hand, from the requirements regarding high recycling rates, HSE, and economics. This results in\\ncomparatively long and complex process chains in comparison to earlier battery generations. In the\\nlast years, several di \\x0berent recycling processes have been developed, which can be classiﬁed into two\\ngeneral process routes, as shown in Figure 3. The ﬁrst group of processes combines pyrometallurgy\\nwith hydrometallurgy and the second group consists of mechanical treatment prior to metallurgy.\\nIn case of a pyrometallurgical treatment, a Co-, Cu-, and Ni-containing alloy (metallic phase) or\\nmatte (sulﬁdic phase), an Al-, Mn- and Li-containing slag (oxidic phase), and a ﬂy ash are produced.\\nAlloy /matte and slag can be treated by hydrometallurgy to recover the individual metals. The ﬂy ash\\nis usually used as an outlet for undesirable elements such as ﬂuorine and hence, it is landﬁlled.\\nIn the second group of processes, LIBs are treated mechanically, often after a thermal treatment step.\\nTypical products of the mechanical process are ferrous and non-ferrous metal concentrates including\\nAl and Cu concentrates as well as a fraction containing the active electrode materials, which is\\ncalled black mass. The black mass can be either fed in pyrometallurgy or treated directly in\\nhydrometallurgy. Depending on the overall process design, the black mass requires a thermal treatment\\nprior to hydrometallurgy to remove the organic components and to concentrate the metal content.\\nIn hydrometallurgy, Co, Li, Mn, Ni, and, if applicable, graphite can be recovered.\\nIn the following, both process routes are described in further detail, see Sections 3.2 and 3.3.\\nFor those not familiar with the applied unit operations, Section 3.1 gives a short introduction for a\\nbetter understanding.\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 7 of 29\\nMetals 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 31 \\n  \\nFigure 3. Possible process routes in the recycling of lithium-ion batteries. \\nIn the following, both process routes are described in further detail, see Sections 3.2 and 3.3. For those not familiar with the applied unit operations, Section 3.1 gives a short introduction for a better understanding. 3.1. Background on Processes Applied in Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Mechanical processes typically start with comminution aiming at liberation of the materials/components. Afterwards, the materials/components are sorted by their physical properties such as particle size, form, density, and electric  and magnetic properties. Usually, in mechanical processing, concentrates for further meta llurgical treatment are produced [41–43]. Pyrometallurgy includes high-temperature processe s such as roasting or smelting for winning and refining metals. Roasting is the term for pr ocesses consisting of a gas–solid reaction, e.g., oxidizing roasting, with the goal of purifying th e ore or secondary raw material. Smelting means reactions that are aiming at extracting a metal from an ore or secondary raw material. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore/secondary raw material, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind. The reducing agent is commonly a source o f  c a r b o n  [ 4 1 , 4 4 ] .

Pyrometallurgy has different advantag es such as high reaction rates, small plant size for a given throughput, and a high overall efficiency. On th e downside, these processes often only produce intermediates that require further hydrometallurgical refining, require extensive off-gas treatment, and are uneconomic for low-grade concentrates [41]. In contrast, hydrometallurgy is based on aqueous chemistry, typically at low temperatures. Hydrometallurgical processes include three major process steps. The first one is leaching, which describes the dissolution of the metals, in most cases with the help of an acid, base, or salt. The second step is purification, which separates the metals via selective chemical reactions.

Hydrometallurgical unit operations often occur as\\nreﬁning steps at the end of a process chain because of their ability to produce high-quality products.\\nTheir ability to produce high-quality products is opposed by comparatively large plant sizes for a\\ngiven throughput, the need for waste water treatment, and a costlier residue management in case of\\nsludges in comparison to slags [41,45,46].\\n3.2. Pyrometallurgy with Subsequent Hydrometallurgical Treatment\\nThe ﬁrst industrially implemented process routes for LIB recycling combine pyrometallurgical\\nunit operations with hydrometallurgical unit operations. The processes can be divided into the\\nco-processing of LIBs in existing primary or secondary Co, Cu, and Ni smelters and into dedicated\\nplants speciﬁcally designed for LIB recycling. In the following, examples for the di \\x0berent process\\nroutes are given.\\n3.2.1. Co-Processing in Primary and Secondary Co-, Cu-, Ni-Smelters\\nDue to the high ﬂuorine, Al, Li, and organic content, LIBs are a di \\x0ecult feed for conventional Co,\\nCu, and Ni smelters with respect to corrosion, slag properties, energy, and mass balance. Fluorine and\\nLi can severely attack the refractories, and the ﬁrst one is also an issue in the o \\x0b-gas treatment.\\nAl increases the viscosity of the slag and is therefore only acceptable to a certain extent, which depends\\non the applied slag system and operating temperature of the furnace. Furthermore, in addition to\\nthe organic and graphite content, its participation in redox reactions adds a high amount of energy\\nto the system, which also needs to be considered. Nevertheless, some smelters accept a certain\\namount of LIBs as feed material. Examples are Nickelhütte Aue GmbH (Aue, Germany) and Glencore\\nSudbury INO (Greater Sudbury, ON, Canada) [ 47,48]. The ﬁrst smelter is a comparatively small\\nsmelter with an annual smelting capacity of 20,000 t for secondary raw materials such as Co-, Cu-,\\nand Ni-bearing spent catalysts, electroplating sludges, ﬁlter dusts, and ashes [ 49]. The second one\\nis capable of producing 95,000 t of Ni, Cu, and Co in matte annually, primarily from sulﬁdic ore\\nconcentrates. In this case, the batteries are calcined before smelting presumably in order to reduce\\nthe organic, graphite, and ﬂuorine content and to avoid explosions of battery cells within the smelter.\\nAfterwards, the calcined batteries are fed into an electric furnace together with calcine from the primary\\nconcentrates. Before granulation, the Fe content is reduced to about 2% by converting [48].\\nBoth plants concentrate Co, Cu, and Ni in a matte, which is a typical intermediate in these processes.\\nThe Al, Li, and Mn content of LIBs is mainly transferred to the slag phase. As a result of the low LIB\\nfraction in the feed, Li is highly diluted in the slag and therefore di \\x0ecult to recover. The organic content\\nand graphite are utilized as fuel and reductants. Halogens are captured in the o \\x0b-gas treatment [ 48,49].\\nThe matte is further reﬁned by hydrometallurgy.\\nFor the matte treatment, three main routes exist, which are based on oxygen–sulfuric acid, chlorine,\\nand ammonia–air leaching [ 50]. The ﬁrst two options are presented exemplary in the following,\\nsince they are currently applied by Nickelhütte Aue GmbH (oxygen–sulfuric acid leaching [ 49]) and\\nGlencore Nikkelverk AS (Kristiansand, Norway) (chlorine leaching [50]).\\nMatte Processing at Nickelhütte Aue GmbH (Aue, Germany)\\nNickelhütte Aue GmbH operates a comparatively small hydrometallurgical plant and produces\\napproximately 3900 t Ni per year and smaller amounts of Co and Cu [ 49].

Simplified flowsheet of Nickel hütte Aue GmbH based on [49].  Matte processing starts with commi nution followed by pressure oxidation leaching at 6 to 8 bar. Afterwards, impurities are removed prior to solvent extraction. For example, Fe is precipitated as goethite (FeOOH) by using H\\n2O 2 as an oxidizing agent and basic nickel carbonate for pH adjustment. Leaching and precipitation residues are recirculated into the smelter. Co, Cu, and Ni are separated and purified by several solvent extraction circuits. Depending on the process configuration, cobalt sulfate, nickel sulfate, nickel  carbonate, nickel chloride, an d copper sulfate are produced in electroplating grade or similar [47,49].

The first patents, e.g., [54,55], describe the use of a shaft furnace, in which Co/Ni-bearing batteries (LIB and NiMH batteries) and other materials are fed together with slag formers, mainly CaO and SiO\\n2, and coke as a reductant.

Therefore, the electrolyte is slowly evaporated in the upper part of the bed\\n(pre-heating zone), which lowers the risk of battery explosions. The furnace is operated at a\\ncomparatively high bath temperature of about 1450\\x0eC, which is necessary to keep the viscosity of the\\nAl-rich slag system su \\x0eciently low.\\nAccording to [ 56], the drawbacks of the process are a very high coke consumption, which is\\nnecessary to carry out the reduction and to keep the packed bed su \\x0eciently porous. Furthermore,\\nthe occurrence of size segregation in the shaft leads to an increased pressure drop over the packed bed,\\nand large quantities of ﬁnes are carried over with gases, resulting in problems at the bag house. In order\\nto solve these problems, [ 56] suggests the use of a bath smelting process instead of a shaft furnace.\\nDue to the rapid heating of the battery cells in the molten bath, the batteries are susceptible to violent\\nexplosions, which can damage the lining. Therefore, and as protection against chemical attack, the bath\\nsmelter is equipped with freeze lining at the bath level. The operating temperature is again about\\n1450\\x0eC, and SiO 2and CaO are added to the feed in order to ﬂux the Al.\\nThe latest patent family indicates a change in direction (Figure 6, right). Instead of a fully dedicated\\nprocess for Co /Ni-containing batteries, [ 57] suggests the processing of Co-bearing batteries and their\\nscraps in a converter furnace together with Cu or Cu /Ni matte in order to produce a crude Cu /Ni alloy\\nand a Co- and Li-bearing slag. Co can be recovered from the slag either by hydrometallurgy or by\\ndeep reduction, producing a crude Co metal phase and a Li-bearing slag.\\nThe advantages of this approach are the ability to treat variable amounts of battery scrap in\\nlarge-scale installations, an increased ﬂexibility to meet a suitable energy and mass balance, as well\\nas the pyrometallurgical separation of Co from Ni, which probably allows the hydrometallurgical\\nreﬁning of Co in existing plants designed for the reﬁning of cobalt hydroxide produced from the\\nAfrican Cu /Co belt.\\nProcessing of the Alloy\\nThe further hydrometallurgical processing of the Co-, Cu-, and Ni-containing alloy is conducted\\nin plants similar to those described in Section 3.2.1.

In addition, the chemical\\ncomposition shows similarities; see Table 5. Besides the listed oxides, minor amounts of Fe and Mn\\noxides occur. Therefore, an economic extraction might be feasible in comparison to slags with lower Li\\nconcentrations from co-processing plants.\\nTable 5.

Then, this powder is leached\\nin H 2SO 4or HCl at 80\\x0eC. Good Li yields are obtained with both media at a free acid concentration\\nof approximately 10 g /L. In order to ensure good ﬁltration, the leach solution is neutralized to\\nobtain a solution at pH 5. Al, the main impurity in solution, is removed under these conditions.\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 13 of 29\\nSeveral neutralization agents can be used. In a sulfate medium, CaO has the advantage that CaSO 4\\nis formed, which reduces the salt load of the solution. In a chloride medium, NaOH is preferred over\\nCaO because Ca is more di \\x0ecult to separate from Li. Na 2CO 3can be used as a neutralization agent\\nin both media but could decrease the Li yield of the process if it is already used in this stage of the\\nﬂowsheet. After the removal of Al by ﬁltration, it is advantageous to increase the Li concentration in\\nsolution by using the ﬁltrate again in the next leach operation a few times until the Li concentration is\\nhigh enough for the next steps. When the desired Li concentration is reached, the leach solution can be\\nessentially puriﬁed of other metals by precipitation between pH 9 and pH 10 with Na 2CO 3. This is an\\ne\\x0ecient way to remove Ca and Mg by forming their carbonate salts. Ca and Mg carbonate salts are less\\nsoluble than Li 2CO 3. Finally, pure Li 2CO 3is precipitated at high temperature (between 80 and 100\\x0eC)\\nand pH >10. The solubility of Li 2CO 3decreases at higher temperature and higher Na 2CO 3content.\\nMoreover, the Li yield in this step increases at higher initial Li concentration. Therefore, the yield can\\nbe improved if water is removed from the solution prior to precipitation, e.g., by evaporation [58,64].\\nMetals 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 31 \\n  \\nFigure 7.

In a ch loride medium, NaOH is preferred over CaO because Ca is more difficult to separate from Li. Na\\n2CO 3 can be used as a neutralization agent in both media but could decrease the Li yield of the process if it is already used in this stage of the flowsheet. After the removal of Al by filtration, it is advantageous to in crease the Li concentration in solution by using the filtrate again in the next leach operation a few time s until the Li concentration is high enough for the next steps. When the desired Li concentration is reac hed, the leach solution can be essentially purified of other metals by precipitation between pH 9 and pH 10 with Na\\n2CO 3. This is an efficient way to remove Ca and Mg by forming their carbonate salts.  Ca and Mg carbonate salts are less soluble than Li\\n2CO 3. Finally, pure Li 2CO 3 is precipitated at high temperatur e (between 80 and 100 °C) and pH > 10. The solubility of Li\\n2CO 3 decreases at higher temperature and higher Na 2CO 3 content. Moreover, the Li yield in this step increases at higher initial Li co ncentration. Therefore, the yield can be improved if water is removed from the solution prior to precipitation, e.g., by evaporation [58,64].

U n d e r  certain conditions, the dissolution of silica leads to gel formation, resulting in severe filtration problems and low yields. Overall Li yields under fa vorable conditions were reported to be between 60% and 70%. Another critical issue is residue management. Due to the low Li content of the slags, the amount of residue from the leaching and precipitation of impurities is high. The disposal of such residues is restricted in Europe and is associated with high costs. A possible solution to this problem is the applicat ion of the slags as a neutralization agent instead of conventional Ca-based agents in spodumene proc essing as described in [65]. Furthermore, this bypasses the need to establish a specific process for comparatively low amounts of slag.

Under certain\\nconditions, the dissolution of silica leads to gel formation, resulting in severe ﬁltration problems and\\nlow yields. Overall Li yields under favorable conditions were reported to be between 60% and 70%.\\nAnother critical issue is residue management. Due to the low Li content of the slags, the amount\\nof residue from the leaching and precipitation of impurities is high. The disposal of such residues is\\nrestricted in Europe and is associated with high costs.\\nA possible solution to this problem is the application of the slags as a neutralization agent instead\\nof conventional Ca-based agents in spodumene processing as described in [ 65]. Furthermore, this\\nbypasses the need to establish a speciﬁc process for comparatively low amounts of slag.

Mechanical Processing with Subsequent Metallurgical Treatment of Black Mass\\nApart from the process chains presented in Section 3.2, LIBs can be processed using a combination\\nof mechanical treatment with pyrometallurgical and /or hydrometallurgical treatment of a certain\\nfraction, which is called black mass. Specialized hydrometallurgical treatment of the black mass can\\neither lead to intermediate products that can be fed into the hydrometallurgical processes described\\nin Section 3.2 or directly to high-grade products. In the following, examples for the di \\x0berent process\\nroutes are given.\\n3.3.1. Mechanical Treatment\\nIn most cases, LIBs undergo a thermal treatment, e.g., pyrolysis, before mechanical treatment\\nin order to reduce the energy content in a controlled way, to eliminate the organic components and\\nto reduce the halogenic content [ 19,66–68]. This process usually takes place at around 500\\x0eC and is\\nlimited by the melting point of Al (660\\x0eC) [ 69,70]. Afterwards, the pyrolyzed batteries can be treated\\nmechanically without ﬁre hazards.\\nMechanical treatment starts with comminution. Afterwards, the crushed material is sorted by its\\nphysical properties using unit operations such as sieving, sifting, magnetic, and eddy current separation.\\nCommon fractions are an Al /Cu foil fraction (conducting foils), coarse non-ferrous metals (Al\\nfrom casings, Cu), coarse ferrous metals (casings, screws), and a ﬁne fraction called black mass\\n(active electrode materials) [10,22,71].\\nAlternatively, a few companies follow di \\x0berent approaches without thermal treatment in order\\nto avoid the complex thermal pre-treatment, which requires comparatively high throughputs to be\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 15 of 29\\neconomic. In this case, speciﬁc safety measures are mandatory to prevent explosion and ignition during\\nthe mechanical treatment [ 72]. One possibility is crushing under inert atmosphere, e.g., N 2, CO 2, or Ar,\\nand a subsequent removal /recovery of the volatile components, e.g., by vacuum distillation [ 73,74] or\\ndrying at moderate temperatures. However, possible drawbacks are high costs for volatile organic\\ncomponent (VOC) abatement, low black mass yields, and high levels of cross-contamination with\\nblack mass and organic components. The latter is mainly because of an insu \\x0ecient detachment of the\\nactive materials from the foils resulting from the strong bonding, which cannot be destroyed by purely\\nmechanical processes [70,75].\\nAnother possibility is comminution in a solution, e.g., in a slightly alkaline medium [ 76,77].\\nThese processes have to deal with organic wastewater pollution, corrosion, wet product fractions,\\nand also low black mass yields.\\nWith the exception of black mass, all product fractions can be fed into established industrial\\nrecycling processes. Black mass is a relatively new intermediate product on the market and the most\\nvaluable fraction of the mechanical processing due to the Co and Ni content. It contains mainly the\\nactive electrode materials, i.e., graphite and Li transition metal compounds containing Co, Ni, and Mn.\\nFurther components are the ﬂuorine containing conducting salt or its degradation products and several\\nimpurities such as Cu, Al, and Fe. Concentrations ranges of major black mass components produced\\nfrom layered oxide chemistries are given in Table 6.\\nTable 6.

Without thermal\\ntreatment, the concentrations will be lower due to dilution by the organic content (solvent residues,\\nbinder and separator residue).\\n3.3.2. Metallurgical Processing of Black Mass\\nThe black mass can either be fed into pyrometallurgical routes, described in the previous Section 3.2,\\nor directly treated by hydrometallurgical methods. Both approaches are pursued industrially. Due to\\nits unique composition and highly variable chemistry, the black mass does not ﬁt into most available\\nmetallurgical processes. Furthermore, besides Co and Ni, the recycling of most other elements is under\\nresearch and development, and an industrial implementation still pending.\\nCompared to batteries, the black mass ﬁts better in most pyrometallurgical processes due to the\\nsigniﬁcantly reduced Al and organic content and higher Co and Ni concentrations. Nevertheless, the\\nﬂuorine and Li content lead to corrosion problems, and the e \\x0ecient recovery of Li is still an issue.\\nIn hydrometallurgy, a distinction can be made between two alternatives. The ﬁrst one is the\\nproduction of intermediates by leaching and precipitation with the aim of producing a Co /Ni and\\na separate Li product for further processing in existing reﬁneries. The second one is the direct\\nproduction of high-grade products by more complex processes. Compared to pyrometallurgy,\\nthe hydrometallurgical treatment of black mass can enable the recovery of more materials, i.e., Mn,\\ngraphite (and Li). However, it faces challenges regarding ﬂuorine, Mn control, an e \\x0ecient recovery of\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 16 of 29\\nLi, and the production of a marketable graphite product. Additionally, the processes are sensitive to\\norganics because of the resulting contamination of process water and possible interference with the\\norganic phase of solvent extraction processes. Therefore, typically only black mass from processes,\\nwhich include a thermal treatment, is used as feed material.\\nProduction of Intermediates\\nDue to the limited amount of black mass in Europe, currently, no specialized processes to produce\\nhigh-grade products from black mass are in operation. Instead, the production of intermediates in\\npilot plants or treatment in existing variable plants can be observed.\\nThese processes are typically based on leaching and precipitation and focus on the separation\\nof Co and Ni from Mn, as most Co and Ni reﬁneries can tolerate only limited amounts of Mn [ 80].\\nIf the black mass still contains graphite after roasting, graphite can be recovered after leaching [ 12].\\nIn addition, the production of Mn and Li intermediates is possible but only carried out in a few cases\\ndue to economic reasons. Possible ﬂowsheets based on common precipitation processes are presented\\nin Figure 9.\\nMetals 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 31 \\n  \\nFigure 9. Simplified flowsheet for the hydrometallurgical route for the production of intermediates based on [12,80]. \\nThe leaching of active electrode material can be  done with various acids [12]. In most cases, H\\n2SO 4 at elevated temperature assisted by H 2O 2 is used. Due to the fluorine content of most black masses, the formation of hydrofluoric acid takes place. This issue is discussed in the next section. Impurities such as Al and Fe can be precipitated as hydroxides. The separation of Co and Ni from Mn is a common challenge in the primary producti on of non-ferrous metals. In case of high Mn content, sulfide precipitation of Co and Ni is often performed utilizing the high selectivity of the reaction. Afterwards, Mn can be precipitated for example as carbonate (Figure 9, left) [66,80]. Alternatively, a selective precipitation of Mn as MnO\\n2 might be applied after leaching (Figure 9, right). Typically, the reaction requires a strong oxidizing agent such as ozone, Caro’s acid, or hypochlorite. However, Co losses in the Mn precipit ate can be very high: up to 25% according to the literature [80]. According to [80], be tter results can be achieved using SO\\n2/air mixtures. Co losses below 0.5% were reported. Co and Ni can then be precipitated, e.g., as carbonates. For the precipitation of Li, Li\\n2CO 3 is the preferred compound in case of intermediates [59].

The left\\nside shows the proposed process of JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). It consists\\nof leaching, precipitation, solvent extraction, and electrowinning. The metals are leached in H 2SO 4.\\nIn the following , impurities such as Al and Fe are removed via precipitation. Then, the puriﬁed leach\\nliquor is fed into solvent extraction circuits to recover each transition metal individually. First, Mn is\\nextracted with di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (DEHPA) and precipitated as manganese carbonate.\\nAfter that, Co extraction is performed with a dialkyl phosphinic acid and Ni extraction is performed\\nwith a carboxylic acid. Co and Ni are recovered by electrowinning as pure metals. At last, Li is\\nprecipitated as Li 2CO 3[66].\\nOne concern when processing black mass is the formation of hydroﬂuoric acid during leaching\\ndue to the signiﬁcant amount of ﬂuorine in the black mass; see Table 6. The hydroﬂuoric acid requires\\nmeasures concerning HSE. Moreover, it can cause corrosion and act as a complexing agent for certain\\nmetals such as Al, which leads to di \\x0berent chemical behaviors of these elements. However, so far, little\\nhas been published about the exact behavior of ﬂuorine in such processes and possible measures. [ 66]\\nsuggests addressing this problem by precipitation, presumably as calcium ﬂuoride (CaF). However,\\naccording to [ 85], the precipitation of ﬂuoride as CaF is pH dependent and only takes place to a\\ncertain extent below pH 7. Furthermore, the co-precipitation of gypsum can be expected, and another\\ncation is added to the system, leading to a higher impurity proﬁle. The German battery recycling\\ncompany Duesenfeld GmbH developed and patented an alternative approach, in which the black mass\\nis digested with concentrated H 2SO 4at elevated temperatures. In this process step, the ﬂuorine is\\nremoved as hydrogen ﬂuoride via the gas phase, and the metals are converted to water-soluble sulfates.\\nThe gas phase is scrubbed to remove hydrogen ﬂuoride, and the dry digestion product is subsequently\\nleached with water [ 83]. The advantages of an early-stage ﬂuorine removal are opposed by higher\\nrequirements regarding reactor design and materials of construction. Another option to handle\\nthe ﬂuorine content might be selective washing of the black mass under mildly alkaline conditions.\\nThe removal of halogens by selective washing is industrial practice, e.g., for Waelz oxide and ﬂy\\nashes [86,87].\\nAnother concern in the hydrometallurgical processing of black mass is the handling of Mn.\\nFrom a circular economy point of view, the recovery of Mn is desirable, but it is challenging from an\\neconomic point of view. In the left ﬂowsheet, the solvent extraction of Mn is a necessary puriﬁcation\\nstep prior to the extraction of Co and Ni for chemical reasons. However, the revenues of the Mn\\nproduct do not cover the costs of the solvent extraction process, which is therefore subsidized\\nby the Co and Ni revenues. An alternative is the use of a dialkyl dithiophosphinic acid such as\\nbis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)dithiophosphinic acid as extractant [ 80,88]. This conﬁguration enables a\\nselective Co and Ni extraction in the presence of Mn. After the extraction, Mn can be recovered by\\nprecipitation. However, the extractant is di \\x0ecult to handle, as it is highly sensitive to oxidation and\\nmetal poisoning [89]. Therefore, its industrial use is limited.\\nIn Figure 10, Co and Ni are won from the strip solution by electrowinning. Alternatively, the direct\\ncrystallisation of metal salts is possible. However, the starting materials for high-purity metal salts are\\noften metal cathodes, as the electrowinning process provides an additional reﬁning step [90].\\nIn the left ﬂowsheet, Li is directly recovered by precipitation as a carbonate. Due to the low\\nLi concentration and an unfavorable Na:Li ratio, which results from the use of caustic soda as a\\nneutralizing agent in solvent extraction, low yields and product quality can be expected. A possible\\nsolution to this problem might be the extraction of Li, using the newly developed phosphorus-based\\nextractant Cyanex 936P (Solvay SA, Brussels, Belgium), which shows a high selectivity for Li over\\nother alkaline metals [ 91]. From the strip solution, the Li can be precipitated as carbonate or directly\\nconverted into a LiOH product using electrolysis and crystallization [ 84,92]. This technology has been\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 19 of 29\\ndeveloped to extract Li from brines, and its application in recycling has not been proven so far. Due to\\nthe discussed di \\x0eculties, an earlier extraction of Li from the black mass is of high interest and is\\naddressed in various research and development projects. Examples are the selective carbonation of\\nLi [93,94] and the application of ion-selective membranes [95,96].\\nSo far, graphite is not recovered in industrial processes, although it is often present in the black\\nmass and can principally be recovered after leaching. Currently, several companies and research\\ngroups are working on the material recycling of graphite. Prerequisites for a graphite recovery are\\nappropriate temperatures /atmosphere during the thermal treatment to prevent the loss of graphite and\\na su \\x0ecient removal of impurities to meet the speciﬁcations of established graphite products [12].\\n4. Discussion\\nIn the following, the processes presented in Section 3 are going to be critically discussed from a\\nEuropean perspective based on the categories legislation, recovery rate, robustness, economics, and\\nHSE. Compared to Asia, the battery production capacity in Europe is still small, but it is characterized\\nby high growth rates. Hence, currently, only low amounts of production scrap are available. Due to\\nprojected production capacities of up to 2000 GWh in 2029 worldwide, thereof 500 GWh in Europe,\\nsharply increasing quantities of production scraps can be expected within the next years. As a result\\nof the complex production process, 5% to 10% of the production capacity end up as production\\nscrap [ 97,98]. Within the next years, production scrap will be the main feed for LIB recycling plants.\\nThe available amount of end-of-life batteries is also currently low and dominated by consumer batteries\\n(8200 t in 2020 according to [ 99]). The return ﬂow of traction batteries is slowly increasing due to their\\nlong lifespan and is estimated to reach about 50,000 t /a in 2025 in Europe [100].\\nConsequently, the recycling in Europe currently takes place in small plants or co-processing plants.\\nTherefore, the costs for recycling are still high, but they are expected to decrease signiﬁcantly when\\nhigher recycling capacities are installed.\\n4.1. Legislation\\nIn Europe, the legislative framework for the LIB recycling is deﬁned by the Batteries Directive\\n(2006 /66/EG) from 2006. Due to the limited application of LIBs in the early 2000s, the recycling of LIBs\\nfrom xEVs is not speciﬁcally addressed. Therefore, the Batteries Directive is currently under revision.\\nFrom a processing point of view, an increased mass speciﬁc recovery rate as well as the introduction of\\nspeciﬁc recovery rates for individual metals would have the biggest inﬂuence. The current required\\nrecovery rate of 50 wt % is easily achieved in case of battery systems due to a relatively high fraction of\\nperipheral materials such as the Al casing; see Figure 2.\\nIn general, pyrometallurgy with subsequent hydrometallurgy will be more a \\x0bected by increasing\\nrequirements regarding mass speciﬁc recovery rates due to their focus on Co, Cu, and Ni and the loss\\nof metallic Al, Mn, non-metallic components, and Li in some cases (see Section 4.2.1). In contrast, a\\nmechanical treatment enables a higher material recycling rate. Therefore, new process combinations,\\ne.g., the separation of Al and Fe casing prior to pyrometallurgy, might be necessary in the future to\\nbalance the individual advantages and disadvantages.\\nOne further legislative framework, which might inﬂuence the recycling of LIBs, is the European\\nUnion Emission Trading Scheme. Currently, the inﬂuence is low but it is expected to grow with\\nincreasing CO 2prices. However, it is unclear which price level will be necessary for a signiﬁcant\\nsteering e \\x0bect, which processes will have a competitive advantage, and how the CO 2price will\\ninﬂuence the competitiveness of the European LIB recycling industry.\\n4.2. Recovery Rate\\nAs presented in Section 2, batteries contain various metallic and non-metallic components.\\nCurrently, due to economic and thermodynamic reasons, many processes focus on the high recovery\\nrates of Co, Cu, and Ni. Li recovery is still a challenge due to thermodynamic reasons despite its\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 20 of 29\\neconomic value and political interest. There is less focus on Al and Mn, but the ﬁrst one is partly\\nrecovered in mechanical processes. So far, non-metallic components such as graphite and the solvents\\nof the electrolyte are not recovered with a few exceptions. Depending on future legislations, the\\nrecovery of non-metallic components might be of interest to comply with required mass speciﬁc\\nrecovery rates, especially in case of battery chemistries with low Co and Ni contents such as LFP .\\n4.2.1. Pyrometallurgical with Hydrometallurgical Processing\\nPyrometallurgical processes achieve high yields for Co, Cu, and Ni ( >95%) [ 55,101 ]. Li can\\nonly be recovered in dedicated processes, in which a concentration of Li in the slag is realized.\\nConsequently, co-processing plants have major disadvantages if a speciﬁc Li recovery rate is required\\nby law. Al and non-metallic components are utilized as reductant and fuel and therefore substitute\\nprimary energy sources. Mn mainly reports to the slag, which can be used as a construction material\\nor dumped.\\nIn hydrometallurgy, metal losses for Co, Cu, and Ni are very low ( <5%), which results in high\\noverall recovery rates for these process routes. For Li recovery from the slag, no industrial process data\\nare available. The literature indicates possible recovery rates for Li from the slag of around 90% [ 65].\\nHowever, the overall Li recovery is presumably lower as Li is partially fumed in pyrometallurgy\\naccording to [56].\\n4.2.2. Mechanical with Metallurgical Processing\\nMechanical processes with subsequent hydrometallurgy enable the recovery of more elements and\\nmaterials. Typically, mechanical processes produce di \\x0berent ferrous and non-ferrous metal concentrates.\\nA high black mass yield is of paramount importance for economic reasons and in order to\\nminimize the cross-contamination of other product fractions with carcinogenic Co /Ni-containing dusts.\\nAccording to [ 75], processes with thermal pre-treatment of LIBs prior to mechanical processing reach\\nblack mass yields of up to 95%, whereas the yield in processes without thermal pre-treatment is\\nsigniﬁcantly lower.\\nWhereas Al and Cu concentrates can be fed into established recycling processes, the black mass\\nis a new type of concentrate, which requires at least the adaptation of existing processes due to the\\nunique combination of metals and the ﬂuorine content.\\nIf the black mass is fed into pyrometallurgy, treatment follows the above (see Section 4.2.1)\\ndescribed processes with its respective advantages and disadvantages. In contrast, black mass\\nprocessing in hydrometallurgy o \\x0bers the possibility to recover more materials, especially graphite,\\nMn, and Li. However, the recovery of graphite and Mn are not established industrially due to\\neconomic reasons. Li recovery takes place in some plants, especially in Asia [ 102 ]. Industrial recovery\\nrates of Li are not known but presumably lower than those of Ni or Co.\\n4.3. Robustness\\nHigh process robustness is a prerequisite for the long-term economic success of large-scale\\ninstallations. As a result of the constant development of LIBs, the processes must be able to deal with\\nchanges in LIB design, chemistry, and size. Furthermore, especially in the case of consumer batteries,\\nrecycling processes need to be robust toward missorting. Another aspect concerning the process\\nrobustness is the required pre-treatment, especially discharging, as some batteries cannot be discharged\\nfor safety reasons, e.g., damaged batteries, or economic reasons, e.g., consumer batteries.\\n4.3.1. Pyrometallurgical with Hydrometallurgical Processing\\nPyrometallurgical processes are generally robust. They are usually able to treat all kinds of LIB\\nscraps within certain limitations, coming from LIB production as well as end-of-life. Discharging is\\nnot mandatory and only pursued by some battery recyclers in case of battery systems to enable a\\nsafe dismantling. Exceptions are LIB chemistries with low Co and Ni content, as these processes are\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 21 of 29\\nprimarily designed for the recovery of Co, Ni, and Cu and battery modules, which exceed a certain size\\nand weight limit, depending on the applied furnace technology. In this case, a mechanical pre-treatment\\nis necessary in order to achieve a size reduction, which allows feeding without damaging the furnace.\\nMost critical elements are safely removed via the gas phase—for example, halogens or volatile toxic\\nheavy metals such as mercury (Hg) or cadmium (Cd) from missorted batteries. Other metals of\\nlow economic value and high a \\x0enity to oxygen such as Mn or Ti are transferred to the slag phase.\\nNevertheless, the halogenic and Li content are challenging with respect to corrosion. Due to the high\\nenergy content, the share of LIBs in the feed is limited. However, mixing di \\x0berent feed materials\\nallows the production of a homogeneous alloy or matte phase for the subsequent hydrometallurgical\\nprocessing. Due to the above-mentioned pyrometallurgical separation, changes in LIB chemistry are\\nless likely to a \\x0bect the hydrometallurgical treatment.\\n4.3.2. Mechanical with Metallurgical Processing\\nMechanical processes combined with metallurgical processes are generally less robust. In these\\nkinds of process routes, the higher recovery rates, especially of non-metallic materials, often lead to a\\nhigh process sensitivity. Therefore, processes with a thermal treatment prior to mechanical treatment\\nare predominant.\\nIf current LIBs undergo thermal treatment prior to mechanical processing, su \\x0ecient yields and\\nproduct qualities are achieved. Future LIB generations might require process adaptations. Without\\nthermal treatment, the organic content leads to a more complex mechanical treatment with respect to\\nthe risks of ﬁre and explosion. In the case of dry processing, discharging of the LIBs is mandatory.\\nFurthermore, product yield and quality might su \\x0ber from organic contamination and insu \\x0ecient\\ndetachment of the electrode coatings. In both cases, the missorting of batteries leads to the contamination\\nof products, which is especially critical in case of Cd, Hg, and Pb.\\nThe direct treatment of the black mass in hydrometallurgy is more challenging than the treatment\\nof an alloy or a matte. The reasons are higher levels of contaminants and a less homogenous feed\\nmaterial. Organic contaminants are typically removed via thermal treatment as organic components\\ncan interfere with solvent extraction and require additional wastewater treatment.\\nIn contrast to pyrometallurgical processing, mechanical processing achieves a lower separation of\\nelements, leading to higher separation e \\x0bort in hydrometallurgy. Especially, ﬂuorine, Mn, and trace\\nelements lead to additional process steps to achieve high product qualities. Heterogenic feed material\\nmakes process control more challenging, especially in solvent extraction and with respect to impurity\\ncontrol. Due to the changing chemistry of batteries and various doping elements (see Section 2), there is\\nan elevated risk for the enrichment of contaminants in the solvent extraction circuits.\\n4.4. Ecomonics\\nCurrently, in Europe, most LIBs have a negative market value due to new and complex processes,\\nhigh research and development expenses, and small plants. In the upcoming years, the market value\\nof LIBs is expected to increase in case of Co- and Ni-containing chemistries because of the growing\\nnumber of competitors operating larger plants. LFP batteries will presumably continue to have a\\nnegative market value.\\nPossible revenues mainly result from Co, Ni, Cu, and Li while other materials are of minor\\nimportance; see Table 7.\\nFigure 11 shows exemplarily possible revenues from one ton of black mass assuming a NMC\\n6:2:2 chemistry and 100% yield of each element based on the prices given in Table 7.

Pyrometallurgical with Hydrometallurgical Processing Generally, large-scale pyrometallurgical processe s are highly cost efficient to treat complex secondary raw materials. In case of LIBs, the avai lable quantities are presently low. Therefore, co- processing has a larger market share than the trea tment in dedicated plants. In the future, this is expected to change because dedicate d plants are able to enrich Li in the slag in addition to Co, Ni, and Cu in the alloy/matte and are better adapted to the specific challenges. Nevertheless, the economic Ni and Co dependency of such processes is high. Under current market conditions, the use of carbon and organics as reductants and fuel as well  as the separation of Mn from the other transition metals seems to have economic advantages. In the subsequent hydrometallurgical treatment of the intermediates, Co, Ni, and Cu can be recovered in established plants. At present, Li recovery from the slag is not established industrially but it is expected to be introduc ed with increasing available amounts. The costs for Li recovery are Aluminum, 0.6%Cobalt, 30.1%\\nCopper, 1.4%Lithium Carbonate, 32.1%Manganese, 1.4%Nickel, 33.4%Graphite, 1.7%\\nTotal revenue:8,400 US$/t black mass\\nFigure 11.

The costs for Li recovery are\\nunknown, but based on the described processes, it can be assumed that the costs will be in the range\\nof spodumene processing or even lower. According to [ 105 ], the processing costs from spodumene\\nconcentrates are around 4500 US$ /t lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE).\\n4.4.2. Mechanical with Metallurgical Processing\\nCompared to the process described above, a higher number of materials can be recovered\\nin mechanical processes in principle. However, it is unclear whether this translates to economic\\nadvantages under future market conditions.\\nIn most cases, a cost-intensive thermal removal of organics takes place before comminution.\\nCompared to smelting, the metals are concentrated but not separated.\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 23 of 29\\nThe main advantages of this approach are the (partial) recovery of Al and Fe, which leads to\\nadditional revenues. In addition, the separation of Cu from the transition metals in the black mass\\nmight have economic advantages. However, Mn reports to the black mass and is currently considered\\nas an impurity in hydrometallurgy due to its low value (see Table 7) and expensive separation from Co\\nand Ni. Solvent and graphite recovery have been demonstrated at the pilot scale, but so far, there are\\nno established markets for these products, and the large-scale economic viability is unknown.\\nThe black mass is still a comparatively new intermediate product, which requires dedicated\\nhydrometallurgical treatment due to its complex composition and to recover all components.\\nThe installation of these plants requires high investments and su \\x0ecient feed material. Currently,\\nsuch plants are only available in Asia due to the high amounts of production scraps in this region [ 102 ].\\n4.5. Health, Safety, and Environment\\nIn most countries, scrap LIBs are classiﬁed as hazardous waste. The main reasons are the electrical\\nand chemical energy content, the carcinogenic Co- and Ni-containing cathode active material, as well\\nas the toxic, corrosive, and hazardous conducting salt [ 9]. All of these hazards need to be handled in\\nLIB recycling.\\nRegarding life-cycle assessment, available studies indicate positive results of LIB recycling\\nin comparison to the primary production in most impact categories [ 106 ]. However, most of the\\nresults are based on laboratory or pilot-scale process data and need veriﬁcation at an industrial scale.\\nMoreover, comparative studies would be of interest but are di \\x0ecult to generate due to the data\\nsensitivity of industrial processes, complex process routes, and co-processing with other primary or\\nsecondary materials.\\n4.5.1. Pyrometallurgical with Hydrometallurgical Processing\\nAs pyrometallurgical processes are high-temperature processes, the high energy content of LIBs\\ndoes not pose speciﬁc risks from an HSE point of view. Halogens and Co- and Ni-containing dusts are\\nhandled by an extensive o \\x0b-gas treatment.\\nIn the further treatment of the alloy /matte, dust formation needs to be addressed during\\ncomminution. In the design of hydrometallurgical plants, the high water hazard class of Co and Ni\\nsalts has to be considered.\\n4.5.2. Mechanical with Metallurgical Processing\\nIn most cases, thermal deactivation is used prior to mechanical processing in order to remove the\\nhigh energy and organic content of LIBs in a controlled way to avoid ﬁre and explosion during further\\nprocessing. If thermal deactivation is not applied, special measures during the mechanical processing\\nof the LIBs are necessary, see Section 3.3, including the capture of VOCs.\\nDuring mechanical processing, dust control is of paramount importance to handle the\\ncarcinogenic dusts. In addition, cross-contamination of Ni- and Co-containing black mass in other\\nfractions can be an issue.\\nFluorine is concentrated in the black mass and therefore transferred to the metallurgical treatment,\\nwhere it needs to be addressed. Otherwise, for the hydrometallurgical treatment, the same measures\\napply as described above (see Section 4.5.1).\\n5. Conclusions and Outlook\\nIn the industrial recycling of LIBs, there are two main process routes pursued. The ﬁrst plants\\nare in operation with typical annual capacities of a few thousand tons. Within the next decade,\\nrecycling capacities are expected to increase signiﬁcantly to meet the growing demand, which will\\nprobably lead to decreasing processing costs as already observed in Asia [102].\\nAlthough the principal process routes are already deﬁned, there are still open questions regarding\\nthe next generation of plants.\\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1107 24 of 29\\nCurrently, battery modules are often directly fed into the pyrometallurgical routes. However,\\na mechanical conditioning might be beneﬁcial to reduce the Al and Fe content of the feed material and\\nto simplify the feeding process by a size reduction of the modules. Al and Fe can be recycled, and their\\nreduction is beneﬁcial to the energy and mass balance of most pyrometallurgical processes.\\nThe optimal processing of the black mass is still subject to ongoing discussions. Both process\\nroutes have their challenges and opportunities with respect to ﬂuorine control and the handling\\nof graphite, Li, and Mn . The further development will be strongly inﬂuenced by economic and\\nregulatory incentives.\\nE\\x0ecient Li recovery is still a challenge in all process routes, and further research and development\\nis required. Besides Co and Ni, Li is one of the main value carriers, and a solution for e \\x0ecient Li\\nrecovery could be a competitive advantage, especially in case of battery chemistries with low Co and /or\\nNi contents.\\nThe recovery of non-metallic components is in an early stage, and the technical and economic\\nfeasibility is still uncertain. Challenges derive from inhomogeneous feed, product quality requirements,\\nand currently low revenues.\\nA widely ignored problem is the recycling of LFP batteries. Although their market share is\\ncomparatively low in Europe, they are present on the market and consequently appear in recycling.\\nThe current industrial practice is to co-process them with layered oxide chemistries to a limited\\nextend ( <20%). However, if their share increases and /or with more stringent legislative requirements,\\nthe introduction of speciﬁc processes might become necessary despite their low value.\\nDue to the complex process chains, most companies do not cover all process steps. Instead,\\nthe formation of consortia is observed. Typically, pre-treatment, metallurgy, reﬁning, and cathode\\nmaterial production are operated by di \\x0berent companies. At present, mainly activities of European\\ncompanies are observed in Europe. However, Asian companies might enter the market as currently\\nseen in LIB production. Due to the experience advantage of some companies, they have to be considered\\nas serious competitors.\\nEspecially in the metallurgical processing, co-processing is pursued at various stages to take\\nadvantage of large-scale installations and to homogenize the feed material. A further advantage\\nof using established process routes is an easier entry of recycling material into the loop, as no\\nadditional certiﬁcation of the products is necessary. However, co-processing in pyrometallurgy without\\nLi-enrichment in the slag phase might lose in importance with increasing signiﬁcance of Li recovery.\\nFurthermore, more dedicated installations can be expected with the growing availability of LIB scrap.\\nIn conclusion, within the last years, signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in industrial LIB\\nrecycling in Europe. Nevertheless, the developments are very dynamic, and further progress in many\\nareas can be expected in the upcoming years.\\nAuthor Contributions: The authors conceived and wrote the article together.

If not handled properly, it will certainly have a negative impact on the environment and resources. Current commercial lithium ion batteries mainly contain transition metal oxides or phosphates, aluminum, copper, graphite, organic electrolytes containing harmful lithium salts, and other chemicals. Therefore, the recycling and reuse of spent lithium ion batteries has been paid more and more attention by many researchers. However, due to the high energy density, high safety and low price of lithium ion batteries have great differences and diversity, the recycling of waste lithium ion batteries has great difficulties. This paper reviews the latest development of the recovery technology of waste lithium ion batteries, including the development of recovery process and products. In addition, the challenges and future economic and application prospects are described. \\n \\n \\n \\n Introduction \\n In the early 1990s, Moli and Sony used carbon materials with graphite structure to replace metal lithium anodes, and lithium and transition metal composite oxide such as LiCoO  served as the cathodes, leading to the commercialization of LIBs ( Arora et al., 1998 ;  Song et al., 1999 ;  Lee and Lee, 2000 ;  Pattipati et al., 2014 ). With the popularity of portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers in recent years, LIBs have gradually been recognized. What really shakes the lithium resource reserve to promote the development of LIBs is the development of EVs. In the past few years, with the development of energy storage industry, LIBs with higher energy density and higher power output have been widely used in EVs. In particular, attention should be paid to the battery development of BYD and Tesla. At the same time, with the policy orientation and the convenience and benefits brought by EVs, the global EV market is developing rapidly.  Figures 1A,B  show the development of EVs worldwide, with particular attention to the development of EVs in China and the United States. It can be seen that since 2015, the global stock and registration of EVs have grown rapidly, and China and the United States have shown an amazing growth trend. In 2019, China's EV stock reached 3,810,000, nearly half of the global total and 2.6 times that of the US, and the number of China's EV registrations was 1,204,000, more than half of the global total and almost 4 times that of the US. BYD and Tesla are the two most prominent EV companies, with more than 40% of the world's 1,357,000 registrations in 2019 1  ( Figure 1C ). They are represented by LiFePO  and LiNi Co Mn O  (NCM) ( Zhu, 2014 ). Considering the blowout development of EVs, the disposal of the huge amount of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) brought about by the exhaustion of the life cycle of LIBs will soon become a huge problem that plagues society. Therefore, we should be alert to the upcoming troubles and actively develop the technology and technical level related to the disposal of spent LIBs ( Villen-Guzman et al., 2019 ). \\n \\n FIGURE 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n  The global registration of EVs.   The global stock of EVs.   The global company registration of EVs.   Recovery methods for spent LIBs. \\n \\n \\n \\n Due to the short history of LIBs, a systematic recycling system has not yet been formed. Generally, a LIB includes a cathode, an anode, a separator, electrolyte, and a case with a sealing function. There are many types of commercial LIBs, mainly including lithium oxides and phosphides, such as LiCoO , LiMn O , LiFePO , NCM, etc. Since 2012, due to the development of EV markets, LiFePO  and LiNi Co Mn O  have occupied more than half of the cathode material market. The electrolyte in the LIBs also contains harmful substances, such as organic solvents and fluorine-containing lithium salts, which may cause great harm to the environment. Therefore, if spent LIBs directly puts in the environment, it will cause an irreversible environmental disaster. In addition, the high-priced metals contained in LIBs, such as Li, Co, Ni, Cu, Al, etc., also have good resource value. In the spent electrode materials, the average content of Li is about 5 wt%, which is much higher than the content in natural ores and has recycling value. Besides, environmental and economic issues are also prerequisites for LIBs recycling. Many organic electrolytes and heavy metal ions have been released into groundwater by battery abandonment and leakage and have proved to be harmful to human health and the ecological environment. In addition,  Choubey et al. (2016)  reported the economic value of lithium-ion battery recycling, which can generate an economic benefit of $22,000 per ton by calculating the value of lithium and cobalt. \\n In view of the above reasons, the recycling of spent LIBs has a considerable prospect and is environmentally friendly, so it is imperative to establish a reasonable recycling system and develop related recycling technologies. This article will summarize hydrometallurgical process, pyrometallurgical process and direct physical recycling process ( Figure 1D ) and summarize the strengths and weaknesses of them ( Table 1 ). \\n \\n TABLE 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n . Comparisons of advantages and disadvantages and challenges for different methods. \\n \\n \\n \\n The Methods of Recovering Lithium Ion Batteries \\n Recycling for LIBs usually involves both physical and chemical processes ( Harper et al., 2019 ). Due to the complex assembly process of LIBs and the wide variety of electrodes, it brings great danger for the recovery of battery. The explosion, combustion and poisonous gas brought on the recovery process are easy to cause casualties. To reduce this risk, spent LIBs usually need to be discharged before recycled. Physical processes usually include pretreatment and direct recovery of electrode materials. These processes usually include disassembly, crushing, screening, magnetic separation, washing, heating treatment, etc. Chemical processes can be divided into pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, which usually involve leaching, separation, extraction and chemical/electrochemical precipitation. \\n Hydrometallurgical Process \\n At present, hydrometallurgy is typically used to recover LIBs after pretreatment. According to the physical properties of the materials in the spent LIBs, including morphology, density, and magnetism, etc. The treated battery cases, electrodes and membranes containing electrolytes will be treated separately to improve the safety and recovery rate of hydrometallurgical processes and reduce energy consumption during the use of hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical recovery electrode materials. Hydrometallurgy usually involves leaching and reduction. It is usually divided into acid leaching and biological leaching according to the leaching method. \\n For the acid leaching process,  Zhang et al. (1998)  reported a recovery rate of over 99% for Co and Li, and  Nan et al. (2005)  reported a recovery rate of over 98% for Cu. The recovery rate of hydrometallurgy is far from that of pyrometallurgy. In the acid leaching of electrode materials, inorganic acids are mostly used, usually including hydrochloric acid (HCl) ( Li et al., 2009 ;  Guo et al., 2016 ;  Barik et al., 2017 ), sulfuric acid (H SO ) ( Dun-Fang et al., 2009 ;  Meshram et al., 2015 ,  2016 ), nitric acid (HNO ) ( Li et al., 2011 ;  Mossini et al., 2015 ), and phosphoric acid (H PO ) ( Pinna et al., 2016 ;  Chen et al., 2017 ), while the organic acids studied include citric acid ( Li et al., 2010 ;  Gao et al., 2019 ;  Yu et al., 2019 ), oxalic acid ( Zeng et al., 2015 ), and tartaric acid ( Chen et al., 2019 ). \\n Lee and Rhee (2003)  used HCl to recycle LiCoO  and revealed the principle of acid leaching: \\n \\n \\n \\n In the process of HCl leaching ( Figure 2A ), the solution has a strong ability to leach Co from spent LIBs and reduce Co  to Co . But the Cl  produced during leaching is a difficult problem to solve because of its toxicity and corrosiveness. For NCM electrode materials, HCl solution with strong acidity should not be used in order to slow the dissolution of Mn. Therefore,  Castillo et al. (2002)  reported the acid hydrolysis process of cathode materials with nitric acid, and achieved the recovery of 100% Li and 95% Mn. In practical application, one of the best ways to solve the problem is to use H SO  hydrolysis and use hydrogen peroxide (H O ) to reduce the Co  to Co . The reaction equation is as follows: \\n \\n \\n \\n For inorganic acids, temperature, pH value, reaction time, additives and so on have a significant impact on the leaching performance.  Li et al. (2009)  reported that under the condition of 80°C, 4M HCl solution was leached for 2 h, 99% Co and 97% Li were dissolved.  Jha et al. (2013)  reported that LiCoO  was leaching 2M H SO  and 5% H O  (V/V) for 1 h at 75°C, achieving 99.1% Li dissolution and 70% Co dissolution.  Chen et al. (2017)  reported the precipitation of Co (PO )  were separated from the solution containing lithium ions. And  Shih et al. (2019)  reported, in the presence of microwaves at 90°C, Co was completely dissolved and average 90% of the total metals were leached with H SO . What's more, more than 99.5% Mn was recycled from solution.  Lee and Rhee (2003)  reported that the solubility of Li and Co was over 95% at 75°C by leaching 1M HNO  and 1.7% H O  (V/V) for 0.5 h ( Pinna et al., 2016 ). In addition to strong inorganic acids, weak phosphoric acid has also proved to be a good solution for acidolysis.  Pinna et al. (2016)  reported the leaching performance at a concentration of 0.7M H PO  and 4% hydrogen peroxide (V/V), achieving a recovery of over 99% of Li and Co at 40°C for 1 h. The effect of ultrasonic and microwave on leaching reaction was studied ( Shih et al., 2019 ). \\n \\n FIGURE 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n  Hydrometallurgical process.   Pyrometallurgical process.   Direct physical recycling process. \\n \\n \\n \\n In recent years, some mild organic acids have been widely studied. During oxalic acid leaching, leaching and precipitation usually occur simultaneously, resulting in CoC O  precipitation and the separation directly from the Li  solution without further treatment. In addition, because oxalic acid solutions are reductive, no additional reductants are required.  Liang and Qiu (2012)  reported a recovery rate of more than 98% of Li  and Co  in 1M acetic acid for 2 h at 80°C.  Chen X. et al. (2016)  reported the leaching performance using citric acid. The recovery of 99% Li, 93% Co, 91% Ni and 94% Mn was achieved by leaching the spent electrode material LiNi Co Mn O  at 80°C for 2 h.  Chen et al. (2019)  showed the recovery performance of 98% Co and 97% Li and transform spent LiCoO  to precipitate and Li-enriched solution by tartaric acid. \\n As a hydrometallurgical process, bioleached metals are extracted by dissolving spent electrode materials with metabolites excreted by microorganisms (bacteria and fungi).  Mishra et al. (2008)  reported the performance of treating LiCoO  by chemotrophic and acidophilic bacteria, and  Niu et al. (2014)  showed the leaching performance of Alicyclobacillus SP for Li and Co in different concentrations, that decreased, respectively, from 52 to 10% and from 80 to 37% with the increase of ore slurry concentration from 1 to 4%.  Mohagheghi et al. (2017)  reported the performance of Aspergillus Niger. The survival of fungi/bacteria was considered, so the bioleaching was affected by the slurry concentration.  Bahaloo-Horeh and Mousavi (2017)  reported the similar results of studies related to Aspergillus Niger and reported the effects of electrolytes in the slurry on biology. \\n Pyrometallurgical Process \\n Pyrometallurgy is widely used for the commercial recovery of Co. The commonly used treatment of spent LIBs is similar to the ore smelting ( Dunn et al., 2012 ). Before the smelting process, the modular LIBs are first disassembled into separate cells and then fed into a heating furnace. Batteries are reduced by preheating, pyrolysis and smelting, successively ( Schakman et al., 2014 ;  Jing et al., 2018 ). In the preheating zone, the heating temperature should be lower than 300°C to ensure complete evaporation of the electrolyte without explosion. And in the pyrolysis zone, the furnace temperature is controlled above 700°C. The purpose of this is to remove the plastic from the battery. In the smelting reduction zone, the material is smelted into alloys of Cu, Co, Ni, and Fe, along with Li, Al, Si, Ca, and some Fe slag. This method is usually only used to recover Cu, Co, Ni, and small amounts of Fe. Since Co plays an irreplaceable role in commercial LIBs, and thermal metallurgy has a high efficiency in recovering Co rather than Li, the economy of this recovery method depends largely on the amount of Co contained in spent LIBs and the fluctuation of market value of cobalt. However, as battery manufacturers consider the value and environmental issues of Co, Co-free electrode materials in LIBs have been continuously developed in recent years, significantly including LiMn O  and LiFePO , some of which have been commercialized ( Etacheri et al., 2011 ;  Huang et al., 2014 ) 2 . Considering the limitation of lithium resources, this traditional method has no development prospect. \\n In order to recover Li from the spent LIBs, the selective pyrolysis method of an arc furnace can be used to convert some electrode materials into Co alloys and Li concentrate. After that, the Li is extracted by hydrometallurgy, and then it is transshipped and stored through the form of Li CO . And other components can be extracted further. The specific steps are shown in the  Figure 2B . This method can be used not only to recycle electrode materials, but also to recycle Li and Fe, etc. in the electrolyte, which greatly improve the recovery efficiency. \\n Asadi Dalini et al. (2020)  reported the usage scenarios and profit calculation of pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy used by different companies. Hydrometallurgy was mainly aimed at the recovery of Li CO  and Co O  and had 10,000-ton processing capacity.  Anwani et al. (2020a)  reported a laboratory-level life cycle assessment and economic analysis for cobalt oxalate from waste lithium ion batteries through acid leaching and roasting processes. For 3 g untreated positive electrode materials, the total process consumption of recovering cobalt oxalate was $0.59 and $0.67 for acid leaching and baking processes, respectively. Recently,  Anwani et al. (2020b)  reported the cost calculation of waste lithium ion batteries treated by acid leaching once again. According to the type of acid used in the process, the calculation for 10 g of untreated positive electrode material in 250 mL acid solution was carried out respectively. The cheapest oxalic acid was $1.06 and the most expensive acetic acid was $2.07. \\n Considering pyrometallurgy could cause the low recovery efficiency, high energy consumption and the production of toxic gases (dioxins, furans, etc.), the development of high recovery rate, low energy consumption and low environmental hazard recycling process has a good commercial prospect. \\n Direct Physical Recycling Process \\n Direct recovery is a process of recovering useful components from spent LIBs without using chemical methods ( Dunn et al., 2012 ;  Yang et al., 2018 ). Before handling LIBs, they were discharged and disassembled into thousands of cells. Then, the small cells were treated with supercritical CO , and the electrolytes were extracted and treated in this process. After lowering the temperature and pressure, CO  can be separated from the electrolyte and the electrolyte can be regenerated. The cells were then disassembled, broken and sorted. Finally, the cathode material was collected and reused ( Figure 2C ). \\n Chen J. et al. (2016)  reported a technology to directly recycle LiFePO  from soft-pack batteries. In the case of no recovery of electrolyte, the spent LIBs were disassembled, crushed and cleaned in the sealed box. Due to residual polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder and material decomposition after thousands of charge and discharge cycles, the energy density of recovered LiFePO  material is low and its electrochemical performance is poor. After heating treatment at 650°C, the electrochemical performance was improved, showing almost the same discharge capacity and energy density as the new material.  Song et al. (2017)  sintered the recovered materials with fresh powder through the physical direct recovery process to regenerate LiFePO  materials from spent LIBs. The electrochemical performance of the regenerated LiFePO  battery can meet the basic requirements of reuse.  Huang et al. (2018)  compared three direct physical recovery processes for graphite anode materials from spent LIBs. The first one was based on graphite heating treatment without recovery of the electrolyte. The second was to extract the electrolyte with subcritical CO  and then heat it. The third was not only using supercritical CO  as extraction agent, but also includes electrolyte extraction and heating treatment. Experimental results show that subcritical CO  extraction electrolyte is the best recovery method.  Zhang et al. (2019)  reported the liberation efficiency of cathode materials was 98.23% by direct pyrolysis and physical recovery. Direct physical recovery technology has the advantages of short recovery route, low energy consumption, environmental friendliness and high recovery rate. However, it is not clear whether the recycled material will achieve the long-term properties of the new material. \\n Conclusions and Prospects \\n In summary, all of the recycling processes discussed above are designed to recycle resources from spent LIBs. However, due to the different technical difficulties and economic benefits, the development stage of recycling process is not the same. Pyrometallurgy, for example, has been commercialized because of its simplicity and efficiency in recovering Co, the most valuable metal in the spent LIBs. With the development of battery technology, the content of Co in electrode materials is decreasing, while the use of Ni and manganese is increasing. In addition, the consumption of LIBs has grown rapidly in the past few years due to the rapid expansion of the EV market, and Li reserves have become a top concern. Therefore, the technology of Co recovery should be transferred to the comprehensive utilization of spent Li. In addition, when developing spent leaching recovery process, consideration should be given to appropriate treatment or recovery of certain materials that may pose a risk to the environment, such as electrolytes. \\n In addition, because the recovery of LIBs is in the initial stage, the current research level and the industrial development level cannot achieve the perfect recovery, namely safety, low cost, low energy consumption and no pollution. So further research and investment is inevitable. In order to better develop recycling technology of LIBs, it is best to do the following aspects: (1) Classify LIBs well according to the type of electrode; (2) Do a good job in battery design to make it meet the conditions of easy regeneration; (3) Cooperation on the recovery of spent LIBs and relevant legislative work around the world. \\n Author Contributions \\n L-FZ organized and wrote the manuscript.

Batteries contain a number of  heavy metals  and  toxic  chemicals and disposing of them by the same process as regular household waste has raised concerns over  soil contamination  and  water pollution . [1] \\n \\n Contents \\n                                 \\n \\n\\n edit \\n Most types of batteries can be recycled. However, some batteries are recycled more readily than others, such as  lead–acid automotive batteries  (nearly 90% are recycled) and  button cells  (because of the value and toxicity of their chemicals). [2]   Rechargeable  nickel–cadmium (Ni-Cd), nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH), lithium-ion (Li-ion) and nickel–zinc (Ni-Zn), can also be recycled. Disposable alkaline batteries make up the vast majority of consumer battery use, but there is currently no cost-neutral recycling option. Consumer disposal guidelines vary by region. [3]  An evaluation of consumer alkaline battery recycling in Europe showed environmental benefit but at significant expense over disposal. [4]   Zinc–carbon  and  Zinc–air  batteries are recycled in the same process. [4]   E.U. consumers recycled almost half of portable batteries bought in 2017. [5] \\n \\n edit \\n Lead-acid batteries include but are not limited to:  car batteries ,  golf cart  batteries,  UPS  batteries, industrial fork-lift batteries,  motorcycle  batteries, and commercial batteries. These can be regular  lead–acid , sealed lead–acid,  gel type , or  absorbent glass mat  batteries. These are recycled by grinding them, neutralizing the acid, and separating the polymers from the lead.{ [6]  The recovered materials are used in a variety of applications, including new batteries.\\n \\n    Recycling the lead from batteries. \\n The lead in a  lead–acid battery  can be recycled. Elemental  lead  is toxic and should therefore be kept out of the waste stream.\\n \\n    Lead–acid batteries collected by an auto parts retailer for recycling. \\n The casing of a  Lead–acid battery  is often made of either  polypropylene  or  ABS , which can also be recycled, although there are significant limitations on  recycling plastics .\\n Many cities offer battery recycling services for lead–acid batteries. In some jurisdictions, including  U.S. states  and  Canadian provinces , a refundable deposit is paid on batteries. This encourages recycling of old batteries instead of abandonment or disposal with household waste. Businesses that sell new  car batteries  may also collect used batteries (or be required to do so by law) for recycling.\\n A 2019 study commissioned by battery-industry promotional group, the Battery Council, calculated battery lead recycling rates in the United States in the period 2014–2018, taking into account battery scrap lead import/export data from the Department of Commerce. The report says that, after accounting for net scrap battery lead exports from the United States, 99.0% of the remaining lead from lead-acid batteries in the United States is reclaimed.  The Battery Council figures indicate that around 15.5 billion pounds of battery lead was consumed in the USA in that period, with a net amount of approximately 2 billion pounds battery scrap lead being exported.  Of the 13.6 billion pounds remaining after exports, 13.5 billion pounds were recycled.  [7] \\n The U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), has reported lesser and varying levels of lead-acid battery recycling in the United States in earlier years, under various administrations, Republican and Democrat. The EPA reported in 1987 that varying economics and regulatory requirements have contributed to rates of 97 percent in 1965, above 83 percent in 1980, 61 percent in 1983, and around 70 percent in 1985. [8] \\n Nevertheless, in October 2020, near the end of the Trump administration, the EPA posted the statement that \"In 2018, the estimated amount of recycled battery lead was about 99 percent,\" without explicitly citing the source of the estimate, but indirectly indicating involvement of industry sources. [9] \\n According to a 1992 EPA  Superfund  report, lead batteries account for about 80% of the lead used in the United States, of which about 60% is reclaimed during times of low lead prices, but more in times of high lead prices; it reported that 50% of the nation\\'s lead needs are filled from recycled lead. [10] \\n Lead is a highly toxic substance, and processing it can result in pollution and contamination of people, resulting in long-term health problems and even disability. [11] [12]  According to one ranking, lead-acid battery recycling is, by far, the most deadly industrial process, globally, in terms of  Disability-adjusted life years  lost—costing between 2,000,000 and 4,800,000 estimated lost years of individual human life. [13] \\n Lead contamination  of neighborhoods has resulted from the process of recycling batteries. In 1992, the EPA reported 29 lead-recycling sites were on the EPA\\'s  Superfund  clean-up list, 22 of them on their \"National Priority List\" [10] \\n \\n edit \\n Used most frequently in watches, toys, and some  medical devices ,  silver oxide batteries  contain a small amount of  mercury . Most jurisdictions regulate their handling and disposal to reduce the discharge of mercury into the environment.  Silver oxide batteries can be recycled to recover the mercury. [14] \\n \\n edit \\n Lithium-ion batteries  and  lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries  often contain among other useful metals high-grade  copper  and  aluminium  in addition to – depending on the active material – transition metals  cobalt  and  nickel  as well as rare earths. To prevent a future shortage of cobalt, nickel, and lithium and to enable a sustainable life cycle of these technologies, recycling processes for lithium batteries are needed. [15]  These processes have to regain not only  cobalt ,  nickel ,  copper , and aluminium from spent battery cells, but also a significant share of lithium. Other potentially valuable and recoverable materials are graphite and manganese. Recycling processes today recover approximately 25% to 96% of the materials of a lithium-ion battery cell. [16] [17]  In order to achieve this goal, several  steps  are combined into complex process chains, while ensuring safety. [18] [19] \\n These steps are: [18] \\n \\n discharging electric vehicles Disassembly sieving [19] [20] Hydrometallurgical Pyrometallurgical \\n Specific dangers associated with lithium-ion battery recycling processes include electrical, chemical, and thermal dangers, and their potential interactions. [18]  A complicating factor is the water sensitivity:  lithium hexafluorophosphate , a possible electrolyte material, reacts with water to form  hydrofluoric acid ; cells are often immersed in a  solvent  to prevent this. Once removed, the jelly rolls are separated and the materials removed by ultrasonic agitation, leaving the electrodes ready for melting and recycling.\\n Pouch cells are easier to recycle to salvage copper despite significant safety issues.\\n As of 2019 [update] , the recycling of Li-Ion batteries in most cases does not extract lithium since lithium-ion battery technology continuously changes and processes to recycle these batteries can thus be outdated in a couple of years. [21]  Extraction of lithium from old batteries is five times more expensive than mined lithium. [22]  However, lithium extraction is done on a small scale (by some companies). [16] [23] [24] [25] [17] [26] [27] [28]  The thermodynamic model is being developed to optimize the lithium extraction; thus, lithium is recycled with all the other metals in one step with less cost. [29]  A critical part of recycling economics is the value of the recovered cobalt. Manufacturers working to remove cobalt from their products might produce the unintended consequence of reducing recycling. [30] \\n A new approach is to maintain the cathode\\'s crystalline structure, eliminating the significant energy expense of recreating it. [30] \\n Energy saving and effective recycling solutions for  lithium-ion batteries  can reduce the  carbon footprint  of the production of lithium-ion batteries significantly. [17] [31]  As of 2022 [update] , several facilities are operating and under construction, [32]  including  Fredrikstad  in Norway. [33] \\n In early 2022, research published in Joule showed that recycling existing lithium-ion batteries by focusing on a method that refurbishes the cathode showed that this technique perform just as well as those with a cathode made from original materials. The study showed that the batteries using the recycled cathode charged faster and lasted longer than new batteries. [34] \\n \\n edit \\n  designates button cell types.  designates secondary types.

Consequently, it can be difficult to get accurate analyses of individual nations\\' exact rate of domestic recycling. [12] [35] \\n Further, in many countries, lead-acid battery recycling (chiefly from automobiles and motorcycles) is commonly done informally by individuals or informal enterprises, with little or no formal record-keeping, nor effective regulatory oversight. [12] \\n ULABs and SLABs are generally designated as \" hazardous waste \" and subject to relevant safety, storage, handling and transport regulations, though those vary from country to country. A multilateral international agreement, the  Basel Convention , officially governs all transboundary movements of hazardous waste for recovery or disposal, among the 172 signatory countries. (The U.S. is not a party, but has alternate arrangements with the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD), and with  Canada  and with  Mexico  (where it ships many ULABs and SLABs for recycling [12] ). [35] \\n \\n    4.5-Volt, D, C, AA, AAA, AAAA, A23, 9-Volt, CR2032, and LR44 cells are all recyclable in most countries \\n    Several sizes of button and coin cell. They are all recyclable in the  UK  and  Ireland . \\n [36] Switzerland Belgium Sweden Germany Austria Netherlands United Kingdom France Finland [37] Canada \\n  Figures for Q1 and Q2 2012. [38] \\n \\n edit \\n    A battery recycling station at a bus stop in  Madrid . \\n In 2006, the EU passed the  Battery Directive , one of the aims of which is a higher rate of battery recycling. The  EU  directive states that at least 25% of all the EU\\'s used batteries must be collected by 2012, and rising to no less than 45% by 2016, of which at least 50% must be recycled. [36] \\n \\n edit \\n In early 2009,  Guernsey  took the initiative by setting up the Longue Hougue recycling facility, which, among other functions, offers a drop-off point for used batteries so they can be recycled off-island. The resulting publicity meant that a lot of people complied with the request to dispose of batteries responsibly.\\n \\n edit \\n See also:  UK battery regulations \\n From April 2005 to March 2008, the UK non-governmental body WRAP conducted trials of battery recycling methods around the UK. [39]  The methods tested were: Kerbside, retail drop-off, community drop-off, postal, and hospital and fire station trials. The kerbside trials collected the most battery mass, and were the most well-received and understood by the public. The community drop-off containers that were spread around local community areas were also relatively successful in terms of mass of batteries collected. The lowest performing were the hospital and fire service trials (although these served their purpose very well for specialized battery types like hearing aid and smoke alarm batteries). Retail drop off trials were by volume the second most effective method but one of the least well received and used by the public. Both the kerbside and postal trials received the highest awareness and community support. [40] \\n Household batteries can be recycled in the UK at council recycling sites as well as at some shops and shopping centres, e.g. Currys, and The Link [41] \\n A scheme started in 2008 by a large retail company allowed household batteries to be posted free of charge in envelopes available at their shops. This scheme was cancelled at the request of the  Royal Mail  because of hazardous industrial battery waste being sent as well as household batteries. [42] \\n From 1 February 2010, batteries can be recycled anywhere the \"Be Positive\" sign appears. Shops and online retailers that sell more than 32 kilograms of batteries a year must offer facilities to recycle batteries. This is equivalent to one pack of four  AA batteries  a day. Shops that sell this amount must by law provide recycling facilities as of 1 February 2010. [43] \\n In Great Britain an increasing number of shops (Argos, Homebase, B&Q, Tesco, and Sainsbury\\'s) are providing battery return boxes and cylinders for their customers. [44] [45] \\n \\n edit \\n The rechargeable battery industry has formed the  Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation  (RBRC), which operates a battery recycling program called  Call2Recycle  throughout the United States and Canada. [46] [47]  RBRC provides businesses with prepaid  shipping containers  for rechargeable batteries of all types while consumers can drop off batteries at numerous participating collection centers. It claims that no component of any recycled battery eventually reaches a landfill. Other programs, such as the  Big Green Box  program, offer a recycling option for all chemistries, including primary batteries such as alkaline and primary lithium.\\n A study estimated battery recycling rates in Canada based on RBRC data. [48]  In 2002, it wrote, the collection rate was 3.2%. This implies that 3.2% of rechargeable batteries were recycled, and the rest were thrown in the trash. By 2005, it concluded, the collection rate had risen to 5.6%.\\n In 2009, Kelleher Environmental updated the study. The update estimates the following. \"Collection rate values for the 5 [and] 15-year hoarding assumptions respectively are: 8% to 9% for NiCd batteries; 7% to 8% for NiMH batteries; and 45% to 72% for lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries combined. Collection rates through the [RBRC] program for all end of life small sealed lead acid (SLA) consumer batteries were estimated at 10% for 5-year and 15-year hoarding assumptions. [...] It should also be stressed that these figures do not take collection of secondary consumer batteries through other sources into account, and actual collection rates are likely higher than these values.\" [49] \\n A November 2011  The New York Times  article reported that batteries collected in the United States are increasingly being transported to  Mexico  for recycling as a result of a widening gap between the strictness of environmental and labor regulations between the two countries. [50] [12] \\n In 2015,  Energizer  announced availability of disposable AAA and AA alkaline batteries made with 3.8% to 4% (by weight) of recycled batteries, branded as EcoAdvanced. [51] [52] \\n \\n edit \\n Japan does not have a single national battery recycling law, so the advice given is to follow local and regional statutes and codes in disposing batteries. The Battery Association of Japan (BAJ) recommends that alkaline, zinc-carbon, and lithium primary batteries can be disposed of as normal household waste. [53]  The BAJ\\'s stance on button cell and secondary batteries is toward recycling and increasing national standardisation of procedures for dealing with these types of batteries. [54] \\n In April 2004, the  Japan Portable Rechargeable Battery Recycling Center (JBRC)  was created to handle and promote battery recycling throughout Japan. They provide battery recycling containers to shops and other collection points. [55] \\n \\n edit \\n India is one of the world\\'s chief consumers of lead-acid batteries, according to the India Lead Zinc Development Association (ILZDA). [56]   India, with its recent rapid rise in average wealth, has seen a marked increase in motor vehicles, and a corresponding increase in lead-acid battery recycling.\\n India lacks a formal planned recycling industry. The industry is not respected, and lacks designated zones for recycling. However, in a nation with a vast population of people still in poverty, most lead-acid battery recycling is by individuals and small informal enterprises, often taking no safety or environmental precautions. [56] [12] [57] \\n ILZDA has demanded multiple changes to India\\'s industry and its regulation, including the registration of all battery dealers, and the collection of their returns, and recognition of the best-registered recyclers, while enforcing punishments for violators of government regulations. [56] \\n Two of India\\'s largest lead companies—lead manufacturer/exporter Gravita India and lead battery manufacturer Amara Raja—partnered to annually recycle 8,000 tonnes of lead scrap from Amara Raja\\'s facilities, and return it to them for re-use (Gravita said it can recycle and process up to 50,000 tonnes of lead and aluminium yearly). The companies said the joint program is to advance environment protection and sustainability.

Powered by advancements in battery technology, the number of  plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles  on U.S. roads is increasing. And utilities are generating a growing share of their power from renewable fuels, supported by  large-scale battery storage systems . \\n\\n These trends, coupled with a growing volume of battery-powered phones, watches, laptops, wearable devices and other consumer technologies, leave us wondering: What will happen to all these batteries once they wear out? \\n\\n Despite overwhelming enthusiasm for cheaper, more powerful and energy-dense batteries, manufacturers have paid comparatively little attention to making these essential devices more sustainable. In the U.S. only about 5% of lithium-ion batteries – the technology of choice for electric vehicles and many high-tech products –  are actually recycled . As sales of electric vehicles and tech gadgets continue to grow, it is unclear who should handle hazardous battery waste or how to do it.  \\n\\n As engineers who work on  designing advanced materials , including  batteries , we believe it is important to think about these issues now. Creating pathways for battery manufacturers to build sustainable production-to-recycling manufacturing processes that meet both consumer and environmental standards can reduce the likelihood of a battery waste crisis in the coming decade. \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Hazardous contents \\n\\n Batteries pose more complex recycling and disposal challenges than metals, plastics and paper products because they contain many chemical components that are both toxic and difficult to separate.  \\n\\n Some types of widely used batteries – notably, lead-acid batteries in gasoline-powered cars – have relatively simple chemistries and designs that make them straightforward to recycle. The common nonrechargeable alkaline or water-based batteries that power devices like flashlights and smoke alarms can be disposed directly in landfills.  \\n\\n However, today’s lithium-ion batteries are highly sophisticated and not designed for recyclability. They contain hazardous chemicals, such as toxic lithium salts and  transition metals , that can damage the environment and leach into water sources. Used lithium batteries also contain embedded electrochemical energy – a small amount of charge left over after they can no longer power devices – which can cause fires or explosions, or  harm people that handle them . \\n\\n \\n\\n Moreover, manufacturers have little economic incentive to modify existing protocols to incorporate recycling-friendly designs. Today it  costs more to recycle  a lithium-ion battery than the recoverable materials inside it are worth. \\n\\n As a result, responsibility for handling battery waste frequently falls to third-party recyclers – companies that make money from collecting and processing recyclables. Often it is cheaper for them to store batteries than to treat and recycle them.  \\n\\n Recycling technologies that can break down batteries, such as  pyrometallurgy , or burning, and  hydrometallurgy , or acid leaching, are becoming  more efficient and economical . But the lack of proper battery recycling infrastructure creates roadblocks along the entire supply chain.  \\n\\n For example, transporting used batteries over long distances to recycling centers would typically be done by truck. Lithium batteries must be packaged and shipped according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s  Class 9 hazardous material regulations . Using a  model developed by Argonne National Laboratory , we estimate that this requirement increases transport costs to more than 50 times that of regular cargo. \\n\\n Safer and simpler \\n\\n While it will be challenging to bake recyclability into the existing manufacturing of conventional lithium-ion batteries, it is vital to develop sustainable practices for solid-state batteries, which are a next-generation technology expected to enter the market within this decade.  \\n\\n A solid-state battery replaces the flammable organic liquid electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries with a nonflammable inorganic solid electrolyte. This allows the battery to operate over a much wider temperature range and dramatically reduces the risk of fires or explosions. Our  team of nanoengineers  is working to incorporate ease of recyclability into next-generation solid-state battery development before these batteries enter the market. \\n\\n Conceptually, recycling-friendly batteries must be safe to handle and transport, simple to dismantle, cost-effective to manufacture and minimally harmful to the environment. After analyzing the options, we’ve chosen a combination of specific chemistries in next-generation all-solid-state batteries that  meets these requirements .  \\n\\n Our design strategy reduces the number of steps required to dismantle the battery, and avoids using combustion or harmful chemicals such as acids or toxic organic solvents. Instead, it employs only safe, low-cost materials such as alcohol and water-based recycling techniques. This approach is scalable and environmentally friendly. It dramatically simplifies conventional battery recycling processes and makes it safe to disassemble and handle the materials.  \\n\\n Tan et al., 2020 CC BY \\n\\n Compared to recycling lithium-ion batteries, recycling solid-state batteries is intrinsically safer since they’re made entirely of nonflammable components. Moreover, in our proposed design the entire battery can be recycled directly without separating it into individual components. This feature dramatically reduces the complexity and cost of recycling them. \\n\\n [   Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter .] \\n\\n Our design is a proof-of-concept technology developed at the laboratory scale. It is ultimately up to private companies and public institutions, such as national laboratories or state-run waste facilities, to apply these recycling principles on an industrial scale. \\n\\n Rules for battery recycling \\n\\n Developing an easy-to-recycle battery is just one step. Many challenges associated with battery recycling stem from the complex logistics of handling them. Creating facilities, regulations and practices for collecting batteries is just as important as developing better recycling technologies. China, South Korea and the European Union are  already developing battery recycling systems and mandates . \\n\\n One useful step would be for governments to require that batteries carry universal tags, similar to the internationally recognized standard labels used for plastics and metals recycling. These could help to educate consumers and waste collectors about how to handle different types of used batteries. \\n\\n Markings could take the form of an electronic tag printed on battery labels with embedded information, such as chemistry type, age and manufacturer. Making this data readily available would facilitate automated sorting of large volumes of batteries at waste facilities. \\n\\n It is also vital to improve international enforcement of recycling policies. Most battery waste is not generated where the batteries were originally produced, which makes it hard to hold manufacturers responsible for handling it.  \\n\\n Such an undertaking would require manufacturers and regulatory agencies to work together on newer recycling-friendly designs and better collection infrastructure. By confronting these challenges now, we believe it is possible to avoid or reduce the harmful effects of battery waste in the future. \\n   \\n\\n      \\n\\n      \\n     \\n       \\n       Renewable energy Electric vehicles Chemistry Energy storage Batteries Recycling Electronics Green Design E-waste Toxic waste Materials science Municipal solid waste Lithium-ion batteries Innovation and Invention \\n     \\n\\n      \\n     \\n\\n     \\n\\n   \\n     \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n     \\n      \\n \\n   Events \\n\\n   \\n         \\n           \\n          —\\n           \\n        \\n         \\n           \\n          —\\n           \\n        \\n         \\n           \\n          —\\n           \\n        \\n         \\n           \\n          —\\n           \\n        \\n         \\n           \\n          —\\n           \\n        \\n   \\n     \\n \\n\\n     \\n\\n     \\n      \\n \\n   Jobs \\n   Chief Executive Officer - Community Services Industry Alliance  Marketing & Campaigns Coordinator TCAU/NZ Professor, Associate Professor or Senior Lecturer of Counselling College Dean and Vice-Master Research Assistant – Cultural, Knowledge and Biodiversity \\n\\n   \\n     \\n \\n\\n     \\n   \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     \\n\\n    \\n   \\n    \\n\\n     \\n     Editorial Policies Community standards Republishing guidelines Friends of The Conversation Analytics Job Board Events, Courses & Podcasts Our feeds Donate Get newsletter \\n\\n     Who we are Our charter Our team Our audience Pitching & Writing Masterclass From The Editors Partners and funders Resource for media Contact us \\n\\n     \\n         \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\n       \\n   \\n\\n     \\n     Privacy policy Terms and conditions Corrections \\n     \\n      Copyright © 2010–2022,  The Conversation Media Group Ltd \\n     \\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n  ']}\n",

If you are having \\ndifficulties with accessing this document please contact  csiroenquiries@csiro.au .  \\nExecutive summary  \\nAustralian lithium  ion battery (LIB) waste  is growing at a rate of over 20 %  per annum  as a direct \\nresponse to the increasing demand and uptake of portable and rechargeable electronic  equipment \\nand electric vehicles . In 2016, 3,300 tonnes of LIB waste was generated but only 2 % of this was \\ncollect ed and exported for offshore recycling . LIB waste generation is forecasted to grow to between \\n100,000 to 188,000 tonnes by 2036. Unfortunately , the majority of Australian LIB waste is disposed \\nof in landfill, which has undesirable environmental and human h ealth implications.  \\nGiven Australia’s historically poor LIB collection, combined with offshore recycling and landfilling  of \\nthis waste, this constitutes a  future (2036)  economic loss to the Australian economy due to the \\nestimated potential recoverable valu e of between AUD $ 813  million and $ 3 billion based on current \\nday commodity prices. LIB  waste contains significant valuable resources  like cobalt, lithium, base \\nand other metals and graphite that  could be recovered  domestically  and reused for new products.  \\nAustralia suffers from the often quoted ‘tyranny of distance’ to markets and a distributed \\npopulation. The low battery recycling collection rates constitute a missed opportunity to both \\ncapture and add value to a waste stream. Recent disruptions to the re cycling sector in Australia \\nfollowing the China waste ban have not affected the LIB recycling sector markets. However, the fire \\nrisk presented by end -of-life LIB has resulted in an international shipping company banning \\ntransport of this waste stream. This  action poses a risk to Australia’s reliance on export for end -of-\\nlife LIB. It is therefore timely to review the challenges and opportunities associated with LIB wast e \\nand determine if it is a s trategic resource opportunity  for Australia .  \\nThere is significant  potential for targeted research to help realise Australia’s opportunity to extract \\nvalue from LIB waste. The Australian research community, in partnership with industry and \\ngovernments can play a role in realising this opportunity and catalysin g a new industry which in turn \\ncreates new jobs for Australia . Through the thorough desktop review and engagement of LIB battery \\nrecycling  stakeholders, the following observations can be made to support the development of a \\ndomestic recycling industry in A ustralia.  \\nKey Finding 1: Dedicated product stewardship  programs and c onsumer  education drives  \\nrecycling and resource recovery from LIB  \\nThe  lack of an appropriate product stewardship program and consumer awareness regarding \\nrecycling options for LIB are ke y issues that  must be addressed in order to increase Australia’s LIB \\ncollection rate . The current low collection rate of 2 % is reportedly limiting confidence and \\ninvestment by industry into recycling infrastructure. General waste collection, transfer and \\nmanagement costs in Australia are costly due to large freighting distances between major \\npopulation centres, without the additional impact of segregation of specialised waste streams such \\nas LIB wastes. Introduction of a product stewardship scheme would en able rapid expansion and \\ninvestment required for a n expanding waste stream. Simultaneously , a  targeted  consumer \\nawareness  campaign  and education program would  help support investment in  recycling processes \\nand technology . Included in a consumer awareness c ampaign is to advertise existing collection sites \\nand work towards new collection points by working with a range of OEMs, retailers and recyclers. \\nBest practice recycling consumer guides for a range of key product ranges, such as handheld LIB, \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  v household en ergy storage products and EVs, would also support this effort.  An education campaign \\nalso supports existing and potential future State and Territory battery landfill bans.  \\nKey Finding 2: A safe and successful LIB recycling industry can be developed by add ressing \\ncritical information gaps  \\nParticipants reported industry information gaps in best practice guides for standards regulating \\nreuse of LIB, end -of-life transport, and recycling of LIB. Desirable information to support a successful \\nindustry included ec onomic modelling, life cycle assessment for LIB reuse and recycling technology \\nassessments. The collection of this information will support the safe development of an Australian \\nLIB processing and recycling industry.  \\nKey Finding 3: A need to identify tech nology processing  options for the Australian context  \\nInvestment into recycling technology suitable for Australian conditions takes a modern approach to \\nrecycling. This requires the right technology and business models for an Australian context. \\nAustralia’s  distributed population is suitable for potential  deployment of mobile processing \\ntechnology . Alternatively, large scale LIB processing could also be feasible if key information and \\ndata gaps and economic modelling can be addressed. There would be a number  of technical \\nchallenges that would require further research and development for both options, and this creates \\nthe potential for the development of innovative technology for the Australian LIB recycling industry . \\nParticipants suggested Australia has the p otential to become a  recycling  hub with feedstock sourced \\nfrom neighbouring countries such as New Zealand . This would further secure supply, improve \\neconomic feasibility and supports either large -scale or small -scale processing options.  \\nKey Finding 4: An onshore, local LIB recycling industry is economically and environmentally \\nachievable  \\nThere are strong economic and environmental drivers for Australia to manage LIB waste onshore. \\nIn this context, dedicated policies, regulations, standard s and certifications relating to LIB and their \\nwaste will support technology development and industry investment in LIB recycling. Australia can \\nview international examples such as those in the European Union and see how their existing policies,  \\nregulation s and resource recovery targets have driven innovation and technology development. \\nFrom this, appropriate changes can be made to provide maximum support for the Australian battery \\nrecycling landscape.  \\nKey Finding 5: Creation of standards and industry best  practice guides for LIB recycling  \\nDedicated standards surrounding labelling, safety, transport, discharge and processing were \\nidentified by stakeholders as key drivers for the success of the industry.  Current standards need to \\nbe modified where applicable  to cover LIB recycling and where required new standards would \\nneed to be written and a dopted. In the interim, industry best practice guides will enable the \\nindustry to adopt new or modified standards and create a smoother transition to a new safe and \\nenvi ronmentally sound LIB recycling process .   \\nContents  \\nExecutive summary  ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................  iv \\nAcknowledgements

The majority of existing recycling schemes rely  on scrap metal recyclers to break down the \\nwaste for export as there is no dedicated infrastructure or technology to recover the value from the \\nwaste.  This constitutes a missed opport unity for Australia to benefit economically, environmentally \\nand socially.  This research will help to shape the developing landscape of recycling and resource \\nrecovery in Australia, as well as identify strategic resources and potential economic gain from \\nfurther development of the industry.  \\nThis report provides results from in-depth interview s conducted with  six key stakeholders \\nassociated with the Australian LIB recycling sector. While the count of interviews is small, it is \\nimportant to recognise that the Australian LIB recycling sector is  also small , and the interviews \\ncapture d 43 % of the LIB recycling and collection industry.  Interview data is reported using the \\nPESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technical, Environmental and Legal) categories. However , to \\ncounter for the low sample size, these data have been combined with a  literature review and \\nknowledge gained from attending industry events and academic conferences over the previous 12 -\\n24 months.  \\nThis report is structured i nto four sections . First, we  review LIB market demand and the valuable \\nresources contained within LIB waste . The second section  summar ises  various product types , \\nrecycling process and  recycling rates. The third section reports key findings from stakeholder \\ninterviews and the fourth section concludes with key observations.  \\nThe goal of this report was to s ynthesise information about this important resource stream to \\nstimulate debate, focus action and ultimately support a broad range of industry, government and \\nacademic stakeholders to come together and invest in activities that support domestic processing \\nof the LIB waste stream in Australia.  The  aim is for this research to contribute to  the developing \\nlandscape of LIB recycling and  resource recovery in Australia.  \\n \\n2   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  Part  I  \\nLithium batteries: an \\nemerging problem waste  for \\nAustralia    \\nOverview, specifications, value, resources  demand and  fate  \\n \\n  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  3 2 General introduction to batteries and lithium \\nbatteries  \\n2.1 An introduction to b atteries  \\nBatteries are energy storage devices which convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy. \\nBatteries use chemical compounds which can either liberate or accept electrons or ions within an \\nelectrochemical cell during a redox reaction. During the redo x reaction, the conversion of these \\nchemical compounds into different chemical or ionic species or intercalation of ionic species into \\nhost matrixes either liberates or accepts electrons/ions. The movement of these liberated \\nelectrons/ions within the cell creates a current flow out of the battery and powers a  device . \\nAll battery devices share a number of similarities in their construction. Each battery cell consists  of \\ntwo electrodes, a positive electrode or a cathode , and a negative electrode or an anode. In between \\nthese two electrodes , a layer of separator with an electrolyte exists , which allows the movement of \\nelectrons or ions within the cells. Depending on the  type of battery , the electrolyte can consist of a \\nliquid, gel or solid material. In addition  to these components , batteries  also contain additional \\nmaterials  such as insulating separators to prevent the electrodes from physical contact and  short \\ncircuit, pressure relief valves and other safety features. The combination and integration of multip le \\nbattery cells are  used to create battery packs with performance characteristics r equired for the \\ndesired application. The choice of chemical compounds determines the nature of the battery device, \\nthe redox reaction, cell voltages and energy storage and po wer capability  (Cavanagh, Ward, et al. \\n2015) .  \\nBatteries are classified into two categories:  primary and secondary batteries . Primary batteries \\ncannot be  recharged, and are more commonly known as disposable or single use  batteries . \\nSecondary batteries can be created with certain chemical compounds that  can be charged and \\nrecharged following use.  These charging \\nreactions  occur  during the course of the batter y \\nlife cycle. Lithium ion batteries (LIB) are one \\nwell known type of rechargeable battery  \\n(Cavanagh, Ward, et al. 2015)  . \\n2.2 Lithium ion batte ry (LIB) \\ntechnology  \\nLIB  have been  commercially available since the \\n1990s (Gratz et al. 2014; Li et al. 2013) . Lithium \\ncobalt oxide (LiCoO 2) is traditionally the most \\ncommon ly used  electrode type in mobile phone  \\n(Figure 1 ) and laptop LIB  (Li et al. 2013 ). LIB  are \\ntypically described based on their cathode \\nmaterials and these materials account for 90 % \\nFigure 1: A typical LIB format in the prismatic structure \\nshowing the various components. \\n4   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  of the material value and around 25  % of the total weight of a battery (Gratz et al. 2014) . Table 1 \\nprovides an overview of common battery types, uses and LIB global market share, estimated as at \\n2014  (Gratz  et al 2014) .  \\nTable 1: Lithium battery types  (Gratz et al. 2014; AAS 2017; Lewis 2016)  \\nType  Application  Estimated \\nglobal \\nmarket share  \\n(%)  \\nPrimary lithium  Single use lithium batteries for consumer electronics. \\nSizes range from button cells to car batteries.  n/a  \\nLithium cobalt oxide ( LCO)  \\n(LiCoO 2) Mobile phones, laptops, tablets, cameras.   \\nHigh energy density therefore useful in portable \\nelectronics.  37.2  \\nLithium nickel manganese  \\ncobalt oxide ( NMC)  \\n(LiNiMnCoO 2) Power tools, electric vehicles EV , energy storage and \\nmedical devices.

This demand  is beginning to push existing \\nbattery technology to its limits. Next generation materials are being developed principally to reduce \\nthe cost of battery production, i mprove safety and functionality, whilst also improving (or not \\ncompromising) performance. Most recycling technologies depend upon recovery of cobalt in order \\nto be profitable  (Heelan et al. 2016) , but  new battery technologies focus on reducing the use of \\ncobalt and nickel in order to reduce production costs (Gratz et al. 2014) . This has obvious \\nimplications for the value o f recycling next generation lithium -based batteries  in the future.  \\nSome of the pro mising next generation candidates include cathode materials such as lithium \\nmanganese -spinel (Wa ng et al. 2014) . In addition,  graphene has been identified as a good candidate \\nLithium battery recy cling in Australia   |  5 for improving the performance of graphite \\nelectrodes  (Douthwaite 2015; Brownson et al. \\n2011) . In principle, lithium metal can offer up to \\n3,860 mA/g capacity compared to the ~360 \\nmAh/g from the current graphite electrodes , due \\nto a concomitant and significant reduction in \\nweight a nd volume when compared to LIB \\ntechnology (Figure 2). This order of magnitude \\nincrease in energy density and concomitant \\nreduction in battery volume and weight means \\nthat potentially Li -metal batteries could \\npotentially approach the same energy density as \\ngasoline for transportation applications (Figure 3)  \\n(Bhatt & McCloskey 2010) .  \\nThe rechargeable lithium metal battery is the \\nnext frontier in LIB development and global \\ndrivers for an increase in battery energy storage \\ncapability is driving current research and \\ndevelopment efforts for lithium metal -based \\nrechargeable battery technology (Brotchie 2016) . \\nThese lithium metal batteries include next \\ngeneration technologies such as lithium sulfur (Li -\\nS – predicted 2 to 5 -fold energy storage capacity \\nincrease)  and lithium air (Li -air – predicted 10 -\\nfold capacity increase) , which both will utilise  \\nlithium metal ano des.  \\nDespite their significant impro vements for energy storage capacity, there are significant issues \\nsurrounding the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. The formation of dendrites \\n(metal spikes/needles) during the recharge process which can cause short circuiting, poor \\nperfor mance and serious fire safety issues and is a significant issue to be overcome during research \\nand development for these technologies (Matherson 2016) .  \\nAn example of research and development investment  is the Centre CIC Energigune and Hydro -\\nQuébec collaborated in 2015 to produce a “safe, powerful and i nexpensive” laboratory -scale lithium \\nmetal battery with a solid electrolyte (Hydro -Quebec 2015) . Another near -to-market example of a \\nnext generation battery is manufactured by MIT spin -off company, SolidEnergy Systems . This new \\nnext generation lithium battery is likely to be half the size of an existing Apple iPhone battery.  This \\ntechnology use s an ultra -thin lithium metal foil in place of a traditiona l coated anode and a modified \\nelectrolyte to allow the battery to be rechargeable. One of the key benefits of the technology is th at \\nis uses existing LIB manufacturing infrastructure  for the development of materials . (Matherson \\n2016) .

The  potential value of this secondary \\nmetal -rich resource, based on the general composition of LIB and commodity prices (as at \\n19/3/2018 ) is shown in  Table 2 . The data shows that the potential value from the recovery of these \\nmetals from general LIB with lithium and cobalt contained in the cathode materials (reviewed by \\nZeng et al., 2014) could be between $AUD 4,400  and $AUD 17,200 , depending on the pri mary metal \\nconstituents of the batteries being processed. The data also shows that though c obalt  is only present \\nin small percentages, it is still the most important metal for providing an economic driver for the \\ndevelopment of recycling processes for LIB  waste in Australia. Similarly, nickel, and copper also \\ncontribute to the overall economic argument for the recovery of these resources. However, though \\nthere is enormous potential to recover value from waste  LIB  instead of losing them to  landfill or \\noverseas, the costs associated with collection, transport, sorting, dismantling and the changing \\nchemistries of these batteries should always be considered when designing processing technology \\nfor battery recycling.  \\nTable 2 Potenti al recoverable value from spent LIB  determined by current commodity prices and percent \\ncomposition of typical LIB  with lithium and cobalt contained in the cathode materials .

The largest  increase in demand would come from the use of speciality and technical \\nlithium compounds for use in batteries and energy storage, with an estimated growth of 10 -15 % or \\n200 -250 kt per annum  of lithium required for the manufacturer of these products (Dakota Minerals \\n2017) . It was also reported that future d emand for lithium specifically for the use in LIB  could \\nincrease to as high as 66 % by 2025 (from 35 % in 2015) (Swain 2017) .  \\nTable 3: Demand for lithium based on market share to 2025 (modified from Dako ta Minerals, 2017) . \\nApplication  Lithium products  Current demand  \\n(kt  per annum  LCE)  Growth per annum \\nbetween 2015 -2025  \\nBatteries  Speciality comp ounds, \\nprimarily derived from \\nLiOH  60-70 10-15 % (200 -250 kt)  \\nGlass and ceramics  Spodumene \\nconcentrates (Li 2O) \\nLi2CO 3 40-50 2-4 % (55 -65 kt)  \\nGreases and lubricants  LiOH  15-20  4-8 % (30 -40 kt)  \\nMetal alloys  Li metal and alloys  10-15 3-5 % (15 -25 kt)  \\nAir conditioning  Various  5-10 3-5 % (10 -15 kt)  \\nPolymers  Various  4-8 2-4 % (10 -15 kt)  \\nMedicine  Speciality organo -\\ncompounds  4-8 2-4 % (10 -15 kt)  \\nOthers  Various  10-15 3-6 % (15 -25 kt)  \\nTotal   150 -170  6-10 % (350 -450 kt)  \\n \\nLithium occurs naturally primarily in continental brines (59 %), and as a hard rock mineral deposit \\nknown as spodumene or pegmatite (25 %), with minor amounts forming in other sources such as \\nseawater, hectorite, geothermal brines, oil field brines and jad erite (Swain 2017; Vikström et al. \\n2013; Mohr et al. 2012) .  \\nAustralia’s lithium resources are exclusively hard rock mineral deposits pr imarily located in Western \\nAustralia, including Greenbushes (hard rock spodumene, 1.9 % Li, 0.3 -0.7 Mt), Mt Marion \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  9 (spodumene with pegmatite sheets, 0.65 % Li, 0.02 Mt), and Mt Cattlin (spodumene, 0.5 % Li and \\n150 ppm Ta 2O5, 0.07 Mt) (Vikström et al. 2013) . In 2016, it was reported that Australia had the \\nhighest production and export of lithium, supplying 40 % of the total lithium across the globe (Swain  \\n2017). It was also identified that the distribution  of lithium wealth (i.e. the countries that had the \\ngreatest economic position in terms of lithium production) was limited to four countries, namely \\nChile (52  %), China (22 %), Argentina (1 4 %) and Australia (10 %).  \\nWestern Australia is the lithium mining  centre for Australia, and interest in lithium is growing from \\nthe mining sector and international investors. With growth in demand for electronic products ,  \\n“Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull identified lithium as Australia's next major mineral export to \\nChina as the super -charged sector continues to ride the wave of an investment boom ” (Lucas \\n2017) .  \\nStrategically, there are connections between the reuse and recycling of LIB and Australia’s lithium \\nmining investments . There is also the potential to supplement primary mineral resources with \\nrecovered secondary lithium materials of the same grade . \\nProjections for the life of global lithium resources are variable depending on  the factors driving \\nlithium consumption used to model data. The U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) estimated that there \\nwas 365 years o f static reserve life for lithium commodities in 2015 (U.S. Geological Survey 2015) . \\nHowever, this number is a general index derived from the annual production from reported reserves \\nat a given time and does not take into consideration dynamic factors such as changes to market \\ndemand, challenges to produ ction or the impact of recycling and reuse  of recovered metals \\n(Humphreys 2014) .  \\nGiven the drive in lithium demand as a result of increasing uptake of energy storage and EVs , an \\nassessment of  accessible lithium resources and whether they were sufficient to meet the growing \\ndemand due to roll out of EV was under taken  (Mohr et al. 2012) . Using data regarding ultimately \\nrecoverable resources (URR), it was shown  that the global resource of lithium was  between 19  Mt \\n(low) a nd 55 Mt (high) , with the best estimate of 2 4 Mt of available  lithium  resources in the worl d. \\nThe  study showed that projected lithium supply was sufficient to meet the demand for a 77 % \\nmaximum penetration of EV into the market until between 2080 (low) and 2200 (high). It was \\nestimated that the global lithium demand would peak at 8 60 kt lithium/ year, assuming a 100 % \\npenetration of EVs, a population density of 10 billion people, and with 3.5 people per car.    \\nStudies and forecasts suggest that in a ‘best -case’ scenario, lithium supply from accessible sources \\nwill match demand  by 2025 . In the ‘worst -case ’ scenario , global lithium stocks are  conservatively \\ndepleted by 2025. This estimate accounts for rising demand of consumer electronics and car \\nproduction (Wanger 2011) . This  does not refer to reaching zero lithium, rather lithium prices will \\nsteadily rise due to demand , which makes previously uneconomic mining zones feasible and hence \\nrecycling more attractive.  \\nSince 2002, there has been approximately a 5 -fold increase in li thium metal commodity prices, from \\n$ 1,590/t in 2002 to $ 9,100/t in 2016 as shown in Figure 4 (Metalary 2017) . This increase in \\ncommodity price is primarily  driven by the demand for the resource in manufac ture of LIB , and \\nresource constraints such as limited supply and resources being dominated by only a few countries. \\nProjections about lithium demand in the future in response to roll out of EV and larger grid or off -\\ngrid energy storage devices will ensure that the commodity prices continue to increase and primary \\n10   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  resources will continue to be depleted, and this will therefore contribute to the drive to recycling  \\nlithium containing consumer products, such as LIB .  \\n \\n \\nFigure 4: The increase  in lithium metal prices ($USD/ton) from 2002 to 2016, inclusive (values derived from \\nMetalary, 2017).  \\nCurrently, less than 1 % of lithium used in consumer products is recycled from various sources (Swain \\n2017) . Similarly, less than 3 % of all LIB  produced globally are recycled, and from recycled LIB, the \\nrecovery of lithium is considered to be negligible (Vikström et al. 2013; Wang  et al. 2014) . This \\nhighlights the global gap in technology to capture the lithium from end -of-life  LIB . Though  Australia \\nholds a significant sh are of primary lithium mineral reserves, the country is lacking technology and \\ninfrastructure for the manufacture of technical grade lithium products, such as batteries. The \\nAustralian Mining Executive Council (AMEC) recently identified that there is a sig nificant opportunity \\nfor Australia to become a market leader in the manufacture of these products (Wills et al. 2018) . In \\naddition  to supporting traditional mining and export of raw materials, this would a dd to the \\nAustralia’s lithium value supply chain, and also provide an onshore end -user for secondary lithium \\nproducts recovered as a result of LIB recycling.   \\n3.3 Cobalt , a critical metal  \\nCobalt is utilised in the cathode of LIB  such as LCO  or the more recent  NMC  and NCA  chemistry \\nvariants . Cobalt is classed as a  critical metal  and  as such the  commodity price  is high , currently at  $ \\nAUD 115,070  per tonne  (Table 2) (European Commission 2017) . Since  a key  economic driver for LIB \\nrecycling is the recovery value of cobalt , it is worth mentioning the critical ity and social licence to \\noperate issues  associated with the mining of the metal . Both lithium and cobal t have been ranked \\nby Geosciences Australia as critical, and subsequently categorised as category one and two, \\nrespectively, in terms of strategic resource potential and opportunity for Australia to supply \\nresources to meet the global demand for technology  (Skirrow et al. 2013) .

There are concerns \\nover the armed conflict, illegal mining, human rights abuses and environmental issues from this \\npoor region of the world. This has prompted the infor mation , communications & technology  \\nindustry to form the Conflict -Free Smelter Initiative , and the Australian Mobile Telecommunications \\nAssociation ( AMTA ) are part of this initiative (AMTA 2014) . \\n3.4 Other secondary commodities  \\nIn addition to the high economic drivers of lithium and cobalt, the manufacturer s of LIB also \\nconsume other primary materials that have the potential to be recovered and used as secondary \\nmaterials in eithe r new products or new LIB. These include base and other metals (copper , zinc, \\nnickel, iron and aluminium) , plastics, electrolyte materials and technical materials such as graphite. \\nMarket reports indicate that the demand for graphite to manufacture new LIB  will likely treble over \\nthe next 4 to 5 years in line with the demand for portable and rechargeable equipment (Benchmark \\nMineral Intelligence 2016) . As the graphite is a relatively inert materi al, it is possible to recover and \\nreuse  it as technical grade graphite for new batteries or to convert it into better technical grade \\nmaterials, such as graphene. Though these materials are not currently the primary economic drivers \\nfor developing recyclin g processes for LIB , they are still materials that should be considered when  \\ndefining the value proposition of an onshore LIB recycling process.  \\n \\n12   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  4 Production and use of LIB  \\n4.1 Global production of LIB  \\nThe improved energy density over nickel metal \\nhydride batteries makes LIB  applicable to consumer \\nelectronics including mobile phones and laptops, as \\nwell as for energy storage an d EV, hybrid electric \\nvehicles (HEV ), and plug -in hybrid vehicles (PHEV ) \\n(Zeng et al. 2014; Li et al. 2013) . The expected  life of \\nbatteries varies between 3 years for consumer \\nproducts and 10 years for EV (Wang et al. 2014) . The \\nimportance of research into reuse  and end -of-life  is \\ngrowing in importance as global production of LIB  is \\npredicted to increase 52 0 % over  2016  to 2020. \\nMuch of this increase in capacity driven by Chinese \\nmanufacturers as shown in Figure 5 (Desjardins \\n2017) . Australia does not currently manufacture LIB  \\nalthough the re have been media reports of a \\nproposed LIB factory for Darwin (Daly 2017) . \\n4.2 How Australia ns use  LIB  \\n4.2.1  Mobile phones  \\nMobile phones are a common consumer electronic device. The total nu mber of phones in use and \\nin storage in Australia has stabilised at 46  million, or 2 phones per person . Sales of mobile phones \\nranged between 10 -13 million per annum between 2008 and 2014. It is perhaps not surprising to \\nknow that many mobile phones are ke pt in storage and this accounts for approximately 50 % of in -\\nuse stock (Golev et al. 2016) . While the lifespan of a mobile phone is theoretically 10 years, \\nconsumers generally update their phone more frequently tha n the maximum operating life. In \\nAustralia, the average lifespan of a phone is between 3.5 – 4.5 years, with an estimate of 3.8 years \\nfor the period 2010 -2014 (Golev et al. 2016) .  \\nModern mobile phones consist of approximately  25 % metal, 30 -50 % plastic and the remainder \\ncomprises glass, ceramics and epoxy. Mobile phone recycling currently only recovers the metals \\nincluding copper, silver, gold and platinum group metals . One estimate of the recycling efficiency of \\nthe metal fraction was between 48 -64 %, which only equates to 12 -19 % of the total mobile phone \\nbeing recovered (Geyer & Blass 2010) . Mobile phones can also include materials with varying levels \\nof toxicity, such as cadmium, beryllium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, bromated and chlorinated \\nflame retardants and gallium arsenid e. The components of a mobile phone do not pose a threat \\nduring thei r use. H owever, the disposal and treatment of a mobile phone at the end -of-life must be \\nconsidered to ensure that toxic materials do not pose a threat to human and environmental  health.  \\nFigure 5: Global production of LIB, image reproduced \\nfrom data in (modified from Desjardins 2017) .  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  13 4.2.2  Handheld batteries and consumer electronics  \\nHandheld batteries are defined as those that are less t han 5 kg in weight, and include primary \\n(single -use) or secondary (rechargeable) batteries. Handheld batteries include applications such as \\nmobile phones, lapt ops and power tools. The average life of the majority of primary batteries is \\nestimated to be 1.8 years. Total Australian sales of handheld batteries for all chemistry types for \\n2012 -13 totalled 17,500 tonnes. The sales of secondary lithium chemistry batteries account ed for \\n24 % of all batteries by weight, and strong continued growth is expected (O’Farr ell et al. 2014) . More \\nspecifically, there were sales of 120 tonnes of primary handheld lithium batteries and 4,130 tonnes \\nof LIB during 2012 -13 in Australia . Australian i n-use stocks of secondary LIB  is growing significantly, \\nfrom just over 11,000 in 2 012 -13 to a forecast of almost 30,000 by 2019 -20 (O’Farrell et al. 2014) . \\n4.2.3  Australia’s electric vehicl e market is developing  \\nGlobally , the EV market reached over 1 million cars on the road in 2015  (International Energy Agency \\n2016) . Based on 2015 data, China is the biggest global market for EVs, including electric scooters \\nand buses. EV a doption is boosted in countries with supportive policies and targets and of all \\ncountries, N orway has the greatest market share of 23 % (International Energy Agency 2016 ). \\nSince 2008, there has been a performance increase in PHEV  energy density while at the same time \\na significant reduction (over 70  %) in manufacturing cost , approximately  USD 1000/kWh to USD \\n268/kWh (International Energy Agency 2016) . The reduction in cost makes EV and PH EV more \\ncompetitive with internal combustion engine s, and greater energy density allows for longer \\ndistances to be travelled on a single charge. Some EV manufacturers have set ambitious goals and \\ncommitments to increase passenger vehicle driving range to over 300 km per battery charge  \\n(International Energy Agency 2016) . \\nCurrent Australian EV sales are weak, and account for 0.15 % of new car sales in Australia. There are \\nan estimated 4,500 EV on Australian roads as of June 2016 (Asghar 2016) , and only 1,100 were sold \\nin 2015 (Lewis 2016) . The majority (47 %) were the Mitsubishi SUV PHEV, with the Tesla and Nis san \\nLeaf both contributing  15 % of the EV sold in  2015 (Asghar 2016) . Current consumer purchasing \\nincentives vary by state and are not significant enough to encourage the adoption of EVs , which  \\nmeans that Australia remains an ‘early adopter’ for their purchase. States an d Territories have \\ndifferent approaches to increasing EV adoption. For example, the Queensland  Electric Superhighway \\nproject has installed  fast charging stations between  Cairns and Toowoomba  (Queensland \\nGovernment 2017) . The aim is to encourage, support and accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles \\nin Q ueensla nd where stations are initially  free to use . The infrastructure will enable travel from  Gold \\nCoast to  Cairns and from Brisbane to Toowoomba in a low or zero emissions vehicle. Through \\nschemes such as this, it is anticipated that the EV sales in Australia will grow and the  forecast EV \\nsales in Austr alia are moderate with total sales expected to increase to 425,000 by 2030 ( Figure 6) \\n(Asghar 2016) .  \\n14   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia   \\nFigure 6: Current and forecast of electric vehicle ( EV) and  plug -in hybrid vehicles  sales in Australia  (Asghar  2016 ). \\n4.2.4  Batteries for energy storage,  another emerging market in Australia  \\nThe use of large energy storage batteries  is rapidly emerging  in Australia , most widely  highlighted \\nby the South Australian 100 MW installation in 2017 .

Key findings from this 2010 report include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Lithium battery handheld inputs per year were 1,960 tonnes and 12 % of the chemistry type \\n(by weight).

The combination of increasing  demand for LIB is rapidly growing , and  poor \\ncollection and recovery of materials in Australia means that  there is considerable  scope for  \\nimprovement  in data collection and materials tracking directly related to LIB waste generation and \\nfate .

However, m ore recent data \\ngathered by the same author indicated that the 2015 forecast was underestimated due to a lack of \\npertinent data, and an annual growth rate of 19 -22 % was more realistic for LIB waste (Randell \\n2016) .  \\nLIB w aste generation forec asting in 2016 predicted that 3,300 tonnes  in 2016 to 137,000 tonnes  by \\n2036 (medium growth projections) as a result of per capita consumption of handheld and \\nrechargeable equipment, the introduction of EV and the concurrent production of waste EV \\nbatterie s, and increasing use of solar and photovoltaic panels (Randell 2016) .

The following year, a report into LIB \\nwaste concluded:  \\n“there is an immediate need to improve processing infrastructure capacity for handheld Li -\\nion batteries in Australia”  (Randell 2016, p.12)  \\nThe combination of the lack of technology to deal with this growing and complex waste stream, and \\nthe inherent value that is currently being lost to landfill or international economies, as well  as spent \\nbatteries being identified as a priority area for Australian waste management  (Australian \\nGovernment 2018)  means that there is significant potential for targeted research to develop  \\nstrategies and technologies for the recycling and processing of s pent battery waste in Australia .  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  19 Part  II  \\nAustralian lithium battery \\nrecycling    \\n \\nCurrent  practices and an international perspective  \\n20   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  6 E-waste and battery recycling is developing in \\nAustralia  \\nFrom collection to processing, t he recy cling of lead and nickel/cadmium batter ies is a well -\\nestablished  and well -regulated  process in Australia . However, there are no  comparable process es \\nor practices in Australia for the recovery of value from  for LIB, despite being shown to be \\neconomically feasible . Consumer awareness of recycling options is the  major limitation for recycling \\nas available end -of-life stocks are not being captured or collected , and this prevents recycling \\nsystems from operating efficiently . Certainly for mobile phones, it is  social rather than economic or \\ntechnical issues that reduce the effectiveness of recycling (Sarath et al. 2015) . \\nA number of programs designed to pr omote the recycling and reuse  of waste LIB have been \\ndeveloped and are discussed here. Though collection is occurring, the recovery of value from these \\nwaste still largely depends on export to other countries to complete the recycling value chain, and \\na si gnificant amount of collected batteries are still disposed in landfill.   \\n6.1 Mobile phone recycling  \\nIt was estimated that 12 million end -of-life mobile \\nphones existed in Australia in 2014, with an additional \\n22.3 million mobile phones kept in storage (Golev et al. \\n2016) . Many of these contain ed a LIB b ut were not in \\nactive use (Golev et al. 2 016) .  \\nMobile phones can be recycled through a number of \\nprivate e -waste  providers. However, the most well -\\nknown recycling scheme in Australia is MobileMuster  \\n(Figure 8). This is a not -for -profit scheme funded by the \\nAMTA , which works with many  (but not all ) mobile \\nphone manufacturers and distributers to promote the \\nrecycling and reuse  of end -of-life mobile phones. Some \\nmanufacturers such as Apple have their own recycling \\nscheme . MobileMuster operates to educate, raise \\nawareness and collect mobile phones across Australia.  \\nIn 2015 -16, MobileMuster  reportedly collected 76 \\ntonnes of mobile phones which included 16,5 00 kg of \\nbatteries, most of which would be LIB (AMTA 2016) . \\nMobileMuster has proven  very effective for capturing \\nend -of-life mobile phones, diverting them from landfill, \\nand serves as a model for future volunt ary product \\nstewardship schemes in Australia.  Figure 8 Mobile Muster Recycling Process \\n(MobileMuster 2013) . \\n\\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  21 6.2 Handheld battery recycling  \\nHandheld batteries include batteries contained within mobile phones, laptops, power  tools and \\nmost handheld electronic devices. Based on data from O’Farrell et al (2014), the number o f \\nhandheld batteries reaching end -of-life for 2012 -13 was forecasted to be:  \\n\\uf0b7 150 tonnes primary lithium batteries; and,  \\n\\uf0b7 1,750 tonnes of LIB . \\nThe recovery rates for the same period were:  \\n\\uf0b7 7 tonnes or 4.8 % of primary lithium batteries; and,  \\n\\uf0b7 31 tonnes or 1.8  % of LIB . \\nThis means that a total of 1,860 tonnes of primary lithium batteries and LIB  were landfilled or \\ninformally stockpiled for the 2012 -13 period, which  indicates that battery collection and recycling is \\na significant issue for Australia.   \\n6.3 Electric veh icle  and energy storage  battery recycling  \\nThe LIB chemistries used for EV applications are similar/same as those used in energy storage \\nsystems. Further, the construction of these systems also has numerous similarities for both \\napplications, albeit with di ffering sizes and electrical performances. From a recycling perspective, \\nthe initial applications, i.e. storage or transportation, does not change the end -of-life processing \\nsignificantly.  \\n6.3.1  EV battery recycling  \\nThe Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries  (FCAI) is the peak body representing manufacturers \\nand import ers of vehicles in Australia. F CAI state that all of their members have a system in place to \\ntake back batteries at the end -of-their life. For  a recent report by Helen Lewis (2016), interviews \\nwe re held with major car manufacturers regarding their end -of-life options for batteries from their \\nEVs . It was found that some companies provide incentives to collect and swap batteries once end -\\nof-life is reached . This included  Toyota, which has  a rebate or discount on new batteries when old \\nbatteries are returned to manufacturer (Lewis 2016) . Another large global car manufacturer stated \\nthat once required in Australia , they would  make arrangements with local recyclers to take on end -\\nof-life batteries and recycle them, ensuring that they c onform to strict standards  (Lewis 2016) . \\nAno ther  global car manufacturer has a closed loop recycling process where batteries are returned \\nto the original equipment manufacturer  (OEM ). However , many EV batteries have yet to re ach end -\\nof-life in Australia  and  therefore this market is presently undevel oped.  \\nThe EV battery components are typically stored within modules and there are many  modules  \\ndistributed across the vehicle. For example, to demonstrate the configuration of EV batteries, the \\nNissan Leaf battery configuration has 48 modules, each the size of a laptop. The battery chemistry \\nin use is blended cathode material  (LMO  with LNO ). Within each module is an individual pouch \\n \\n22   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  (Figure 9) . This equates to approximately 250 kg of batteries in each Nissan Leaf. End -of-life is \\nexpected to be approximately 10 years when batteries could be expected to have 70  to 80  % of their \\noriginal capacity . At t his capacity, this  will reduce  the  EV range , and hence  will  require  replacement  \\n(QNovo 2017) .  \\nWhile currently , almost all EV batteries  are exported from Australia for end -of-life processing, it is \\nunlikely that these batteries will be immediately processed for recycling in future.  Most car \\nmanufacturers advertise that they are exploring new energy storage markets for spent EV batteries , \\notherwise known as “second life”,  give n their capacity levels will still be greater than 50 % (Lewis \\n2016) .  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 9: Nissan Leaf battery modules (www.wikipedia.com) . \\n6.3.2  Recommendations for improved EV recycling  \\nA comprehensive study ( Gaines 2014)  on future considerations for automotive LIB recycling \\ndiscussed  the lessons learned from other earlier battery types , such as the lead acid battery . The \\nstudy noted that lead acid battery recycling was effective because the batteries were of a standard \\ndesign and disassembly protocols, there was  only a single chemistry type that did not require \\nsegregation  (unlike LIB) , and as such, the recycling process was simple. In addition, lead acid battery \\nrecycling was also driven by  Federal and State  Government regulation making it illegal to dispose \\nthe m to landfill. These factors ultimately allowed the development a profitable recycling industry \\nfor these batteries.  \\nWhen compared to LIB , lead acid batteries have a standard location in the vehicle . LIB  can be \\ndistributed across the vehicle and are more complex to remove. LIB  in EV are complex, with  100 -\\n5,000 individual cells, comprised as modules within a pack, connected to a circuit panel  (Figure 10) . \\nAs such,  removal and discharge process is also complicated, requiring trained professionals  and a \\nhigh level of manual handling to correctly disassemble the battery from the car  (Gaines 2014) .  \\nGiven the challenges associated with the design and assembly of LIB , the study by Gaines (2014) \\nrecommended that recycling of these batteries could be promoted and made more efficient and \\neconomically viable through the use of economic incentives, regulation to enforce recycling and \\n\\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  23 resource recovery, effective and standardised labelling for efficien t sorting and segregation, \\nimproved separation technologies  for variable cathode materials, and an overall standardised \\ndesign of LIB batteries for EV use (Gaines, 2014).  \\n \\n \\nFigure 10: Lead a cid battery (left) and  LIB  (right) . \\n6.3.3  Ene rgy storage battery recycling  \\nEnergy storage batteries cover a range of applications including  grid -connected systems (e.g. \\nresidential solar storage ) and  grid support (e.g. frequency regulation, backup power ), as well as  off -\\ngrid or standalone application s (e.g. remote area power, backup power, micro grids ). Energy storage \\nbattery construction is similar for all applications with the differences mainly lying in siz e (number \\nof cells) and associated hardware and/or firmware (Figure 11).  \\n \\nFigure 11 Example of energy storage battery components.  \\n \\n \\n\\n24   |  Lithium battery recycling in Au stralia  The battery cells are in single modules comprised of either spiral wound cells (most common 18650 \\nfor mat, similar in size to a D -sized alkaline battery) or in pouch  and/or laminate cell format. The \\nnumber of modules is dependent on the overall energy storage unit size and partially determined \\nby the LIB chemistry. In addition to this battery pack, a range  of sensors, battery management \\nsystem and communications electronics also is present. Some manufacturers also place the invertor \\nrequired for connection to the grid/load inside the system box. Dependent on the overall size of the  \\nenergy storage system, th ere may also be additional electronics and hardware in place. Typically the \\nbattery packs will contain some form of cooling system, from simple air flow through to complex \\nliquid cooling and associated hardware. These additional hardware components are sim ilar to those \\nfound in EV systems.  \\nAlthough the major LIB cell manufacturers are the same as EV cell manufacturers, the re are  \\nnumerous pack and system assemblers and retail organisations . This  means that t he supply chain \\nwithin the electricity grid and off -grid  battery sector is more complex than the automotive sector . \\nThe retail sector is at an early stage within Australia and there is a 10 -15 year lead time before \\nbatteries need to be recycled. Many companies do not yet have , and are not required to ha ve, a \\nrecycling plan in place for end -of-life batteries (Lewis 2016) .  \\n6.4 Australian battery recyc ling is a developing industry  \\nThere are only a small number of battery recyclers in Australia. Most collect and export batteries \\nfor processing. There are seven companies listed on the ABRI website as prov iding a collection and \\nrecycling service for LIB : CMA Ecocycle;  Envirostream ; MRI (Aust) Pty Ltd ; PF Metals ; Powercell \\n(Australia) Trading Pty Ltd;  SIMs Recycling Solutions ; and  Tes -Amm Australia Pty Ltd  (ABRI 2018) . Of \\nall these companies, Envirostream is the only company in Australia that undertakes a form of initial \\ndomestic pre -processing for end -of-life batteries and other e -waste . H owever, valuable cathodic \\npowders  are  exported offs hore  for recovery  which means the  value is realised by other countries.  \\nEnvirostream  Australia, a company created by PF Metals,  is a family owned and operated company \\nof metal recyclers based in Melbourne, Victoria. In 2015, they announced they would begin \\nprocessing batteries at the Melbourne site. They accept LIB , NiMH and silver oxide batteries. Any \\nbatteries dropped off at the ir Melbourne site are currently processed free of charge  (as of Feb ruary  \\n2018) . Their process consists of sorting by chemistry, and a lkaline, lithium, nickel and lead based \\nbatteries ar e processed separately (Lewis 2016) . Batteries are discharged, disassembled, granulated \\nand the dust fraction conta ining valuable metals is recovered. This dust fraction contains aluminium, \\ncopper and steel, which are removed and recycled locally. The remaining dust containing lithium, \\ncobalt, manganese and nickel,  is exported to Korea for hydrometallurgical processing  and recovery \\nof the metals. Plastics are also recovered and sold for reuse . PF Metals  state d on their website that \\nthey recover 95 % of the battery waste stream  (PF Metals 2017) .  \\nNew recyclers are also developing a footprint in Australia. One example is Neometals in WA who is \\ncurrently at a pilot scale stage with plans to build a commercial lithium battery recycling plant in  \\n2019.  Neometals is a company with lithium mines in Mt Marion and a LiOH production facility  in \\nKalgoorlie , both located in Western Australia . More recently , Neometals has been running a lithium  \\nbattery recycling  pilot -plant in Montreal, Canada and is in the proce ss of commercialising this \\ntechnology and  developing plants in Australia  (Neometals 2018) .  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  25 7 Recycling and reuse  of LIB  \\nThough no complete recycling process for LIB  currently exist s within Australia, the development o f \\ntechnology for resource recovery is being developed on a global scale, and is practiced commercially  \\nin a number of European and Asian  countries. Similarly, the reuse  of LIB  to make second -life \\nbatteries is also a key research area in Australia and aroun d the world. This chapter  review s \\nliterature regarding the technical recovery of value from or reuse  of LIB  waste .  \\n7.1 Collection, sorting, dismantling  \\nEfficient resource recovery from any waste stream relies on collection and sorting processes at the \\nfront e nd of the process. Generally, the  collection, sorting and pre -processing of wastes is the most \\nsignificant challenge associated with efficient recycling, and relies on the consumer to undertake \\nthe majority of the work at the home  or workplace  to ensure th at relatively clean, contaminant -free \\nwaste streams can be supplied to recycling facilities. Many studies have reported that consumer \\nbehaviour can impact the downstream efficiency of recycling programs, and as a result, consumer \\neducation and awareness pr ograms are required to promote resource recovery rates  (Park & Ha \\n2014) . \\nCollection, sorting and dismantling of LIB  is also a significant challenge for the recycling and \\nprocessing of battery wastes. Collection and transport costs for waste management are high in \\nAustralia  due to freight distances between population centres , without considering the collection \\nof specialised and segregated wastes streams such as LIB wastes. In general, most battery waste is \\nmixed, and although some automated sorting exists, a large amount of manual sorting is still \\nrequired. This is mostly due to inconsistencies related to chemistry type and the  poor labelling of \\nbattery wastes.  Usually, manu al dismantling to remove plastic covers, and shredding and milling are \\nthe minimum requirements  for LIB processing , but often chemical or thermal pre -treatment is \\nrequired prior to metal recovery .  \\nThe overall value that could be recovered from battery was te would be  largely depend ent  on the \\ncost of collection, transport and dismantling and sorting of the waste prior to processing and the \\nfluctuation  of commodity prices over time, and these will significantly change the economic \\nfeasibility of process desig n and development for recycling in Australia.  \\n7.2 Metals recovery  \\nMetals are traditionally recovered from e-waste , including spent batteries, using pyrometallurgical \\nor hydrometallurgical techniques (Zeng & Li 2014; Xu et al. 2008) . A summary of some of the major \\nglobal companies, their processes, product and capacity  for LIB recycling is summarised in Table 6  \\n(Heelan et al. 2016) . \\n \\n26   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  Table 6 Summary of global lithium battery recyclers  (Heelan et al., 2016b ).  \\nCompany  Process classification  Produc t Annual capacity  \\nARetriev  Hydrometallurgy  Cobalt cake, Li 2CO 3, \\nCu/Al foil  3,500 tonnes  \\nUmicore  Pyrometallurg y and \\nhydrometallurg y Co-Ni-Cu alloy, cathode \\nslag for construction \\nmaterials, Fe  7,000 tonnes  \\nRecupyl  Hydrometallurgy  Co(III)OH 3, Li 2CO 3, steel  110 tonnes  \\nXstrata Nickel  Pyrometallurg y Ni, Co, Cu alloys  3,000 tonnes  \\nBatrec  Mechanical treatment \\nand hydrometallurgy  Co, Ni scrap, non -\\nferrous metals , Mn \\noxides, plastic  1,000 tonnes  \\nAccuree  Pyrometallurg y Co alloy, Li 2CO 3 1,000 tonnes  \\n7.2.1  Pyrometallurgy  \\nPyrometallurgy typically involves the direct smelting of wastes at high temperatures and typically \\nhas high recovery of valuable metals , such as cobalt and nickel,  from battery waste. Processes are \\nrobust and do not need to be specifically t ailored for the treatment of a waste with specific \\ncomposition, which is an advantage for heterogeneous wastes like e-wastes and battery waste.  \\nHowever, there are  a negative environmental impact s due to high energy consumption and \\nemissions of pollutants ( e.g. CO 2, dioxins and furans), and  the loss of  lower value metals  and \\nmaterials  such as lithium, manganese, iron or aluminium  and plastics , which  are difficult or not \\nfeasible to recover (Pagnanelli et al. 2016; Zeng & Li 2014; Xu et al. 2008) .  \\n7.2.2  Hydrometallurgy  \\nIn principle, hydrometallurgical treatment of battery wastes can allow the recovery of all metal and \\nnon -metal components present in the waste.  However, a significant amount of pre -treatment is \\nrequired to promote  recovery  efficiency. Often, pre -treatment is manua l, and when undertaken at \\nlarge -scale, this manual pre -treatment can result in high processing costs  (Pagna nelli et al. 2016; \\nZeng & Li 2014) . This allows the recovery of most plastics associated with the casing materials. The \\npre -prepared electrode powders are then subject to digestion with acids or alkalis in order to \\nsolubilise metals contained in the was te. The c ost and regeneration of reagents, as well as treatment \\nof hazardous waste t hat are produced are also significant issues with hydrometallurgical processing. \\nMetal recovery  can also be affected detrimentally by small changes in feed composition. Was te \\ngenerated from LIB  is heterogeneous, often containing variable concentrations of many metals, and \\nhence, processing with hydrometallurgy can be difficult (Pagnanelli et al. 2016; Zeng & Li 2014) . \\nLIB are characterised as p olymetallic secondary resources, with predominantly metal oxides and \\nhydroxides as the main metallic components (Xin et al. 2009). Previously, leaching of spent LIB  has \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  27 been undertaken using strong (< 2 M) inorganic acids (HCl, H 2SO 4, HNO 3) at elevated tem peratures \\n(< 7 0 °C) with yields close to 100 % for both lithium and cobalt  (Jha et al. 2013; Contestabile et al. \\n2001; Zhang et al. 1998; Hendrickson et al. 2015; Li et al. 2009) . Leaching efficiencies for both lithium \\nand cobalt become reduced when leaching is undertaken at lower temperatures and with weaker \\ninorganic or organic acid s, which indicates that the mechanism of leaching is by acid dissolution  \\n(Zeng, Li & Liu 2015; Z.  Li et al. 2014; Niu et al. 2014; Mishra et al. 2008) . The efficiency of cobalt and \\nmanganese recovery has been improved by the addition of reductants to solution which promote \\nthe conversion of Co3+ to Co2+ and Mn4+ to Mn2+ for the  recovery by downstre am processing, and \\nalso reduces the volume and strength of acid required for metal dissolution (Meshram et al. 2015; \\nZhu et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2011) . \\n7.2.3  Next generation battery recycling processes  \\nAlternative leaching reagents, the regeneration of reagents and the  treatment of waste products \\nare the focus of much research directed at  reducing the environmental footprint of \\nhydrometallurgical processes  in general  (Kaksonen et al. 2014 a). Ferric iron is commonly used as a \\nlixiviant (liquid medium used for metal extraction in hydrometallurgy)  as it  can be produced \\nbiologically in a low cost and efficient manner, and is effective as a strong oxidant  for leaching \\nsulfide mineral s and mine wastes (Rawlings et al. 2003; Rawlings 2002; Kaksonen et al. 2014 b; \\nDutrizac & MacDonald 1974) .  \\nThe chemical  production of ferric  iron from ferrous iron with oxygen as the oxidant is very slow. The \\niron oxidation  rate  can be substantially improved with the addition of  iron oxidising microorganisms , \\nespecially when the pH of the system is below 2 (Colmer et al. 1950; Colmer & Hinkle 1947; Bosecker \\n1997; Rawlings 2002) . Bioleach ing, or the use of microorganisms to assist  with mineral and metal \\nleaching processes, focusses on the use of these iron oxidising microorganisms to produce ferric \\niron lixiviant instead of using inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric a cid , and \\noxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide,  to drive the leaching processes. The ferric iron acts on the \\nmineral and is reduced back to ferrous iron to complete the iron oxidation -reduction cycle. This, in \\ncombination with sulfur oxidation undertaken by sulfur oxidising microorganisms to produce \\nbiogenic acids results in efficient decomposition and solubilisation of sulfide minerals in ores and \\nwaste materials  that may be difficult or uneconomic to process traditionally .  \\nWhilst bioleaching remains a viab le option for the treatment of most metal containing wastes, \\nprevious research has indicated that the microorganisms that are commonly used to assist with \\nmetal recovery from minerals and wastes from mining and industry are inhibited by less than 1 % \\n(w/v)  pulp density of battery waste due to the polymetallic and complex nature of the waste  (Mishra \\net al. 2008; Zeng et al. 2012; Niu et al. 2014) . This means that  the  traditional application of iron and \\nsulfur oxidising microbes for the direct bioleaching of battery waste may not be suit able. However, \\nthe generation of ferric iron by iron oxidising microorganisms and the application of the biogenic \\nferric iron to battery waste in a separate system still warrants further investigation.  \\nIn addition to ferric iron, other alternative  lixivia nts such as organic and amino acids as well as acids \\ngenerated by other alternative processes , have been inves tigated for their use in  metal recovery  \\nfrom battery waste, as they are comparatively more environmentally friendly and biodegradable \\nthan their inorganic  chemical counterparts  (Li et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015; Zeng, Li & Shen 2015; Boxall \\net al. 2018) . \\n28   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia   In most instances, these lixiviants have been shown to be less stable and less efficient in th e \\nleaching due to their lower strength  and the reagent consuming nature of the battery waste itself. \\nIn most studies undertaken to date, the use of these biologically produced reagents results in less \\nefficient solubilisation of metals, but there is potent ial to improve leach yields by optimising battery \\nwaste  pre -treatment and leach conditions.  \\n7.3 Recovery of other materials  \\nIn addition to the recovery of metals, there is further opportunity to recover and recycle other \\nmaterials used in LIB manufacture to f urther add value to processing of these wastes ( Moradi and \\nBotte, 2016; Singh et al., 2017; Sabisch et al., 2018 ). Recycling and reuse of plastics associated with \\nbattery casings without using pyrolysis would also reduce the environmental impacts associate d \\nwith processing ( Boyden et al., 2016 ). Generally, plastics can be recovered at the mechanical \\nprocessing stage, where plastics, copper, aluminium and steel can be selectively removed during \\ncrushing and sieving (Xu et al. 2008) . This pre -processing of the LIB waste allows concentration of \\nthe valuable cathodic components prior to recovery via pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, or \\nalternative methods and is currentl y being undertaken on a small scale in Victoria (Xu et al. 2008) . \\nTechnical challenges exist regarding the separation and purification of the plastics, copper and \\naluminium foils, as these still represent valuable waste streams and would contribute to the \\neconomic feasibility of processing.  \\nSimilarly, there is potential  for the recovery and regeneration of electrolyte salts used in LIB.  \\nPrevious studies have focussed on the extraction of electrolytes into organic solvents, such as \\nethanol or isobutylalcohol immediately following the sorting and dismantling process and pr ior to \\nfurther processing to recover the metals. Furthermore, the recovery of electrolyte solutions could \\nalso allow the metals contained within the cathode to become more amenable to leaching, as the \\nsolvation would simultaneously dissolve the polyvinylid ene fluoride (PVDF) binder materials that \\nare used for linking the cathode and aluminium foils together (Xu et al. 2008) .  \\nGenerally, in metal recovery processes for fine cathodic powders, graphite is considered to be an \\nimpurity and the focus on recycling process is primarily on the recovery of metals  (Li et al. 2016) . As \\ngraphite  is a relatively inert material, it has the ability to withstand har sh processing conditions, \\nthere is the potential to be recovered prior to or after metal recovery  and this could supplement \\nthe  use of naturally -occurring  graphite for many technical applications (Zhang et al. 2017) . It was \\nalso suggested that the graphite can be used as a reducing agent to facilitate the recovery of metal s \\nduring hydrometallurgical processing  (Li et al. 2016) . More rece nt research has suggested that the \\ngraphite can be recovered from electrode powders, and converted into graphene  (Zhang et al. \\n2017) .  \\n7.4 Technical challenges for LIB recycling  \\nTechnical challenges are generally a result of the complex and heterogeneous nature of th e wastes, \\nthe generation of toxic emissions, or the loss of some lower value metals from processes ( Pagnanelli \\net al. 2016; Zeng & Li 2014; Xu et al. 2008 ). It is apparent from the literature that the technical \\ndevelopment of processes associated with the recovery of resources is not as challenging as \\naddressing the front end logistics of a waste management process dedicated to lithium ion batteries \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  29 in Australia. Though it is likely that the dominant chemistry types of LIB will change as innovation \\nand tech nical development of new battery materials progresses, it is likely that these factors would  \\nit will mostly impact the pre -processing and process optimisation of and the economics associated \\nwith the types of materials recovered, and not the type of proces s implemented for recycling.  \\n7.5 Battery reuse   \\n7.5.1  EV to Energy Storage  \\nMuch of the focus of end -of-life batteries is that \\nof recycling. However, one step above recyc ling \\nin the waste hierarchy (Figure 12)  is reuse, as this \\nis an improved use of precious resources with \\nbetter environmental outcomes. It is widely \\naccepted that once EV batteries  reach a point of \\nend -of-life within vehicles, they may be used for \\nenergy storage (Gaines 2014; Ahmadi et al. \\n2014) , sometimes known as ‘second life’ \\nbatteries. Most manufacturers are partnering or \\nindependently expl oring energy storage \\nsolutions for their vehicle batteries for example, \\nNissan and Eaton (Vaughan 2017) , Renault and \\nPowervault (Renault 2017)  and BMW.  \\nThe reuse option is linked with forecast growth in the EV market, and continual and steady access \\nto end -of-life batteries from this sector.  Due to the high energy and power requirements of \\ntrans portation , a LIB is deemed to have reached end -of-life when it approaches 80  % of its initial \\ncapacity  and can no longer provide the required energy  for vehicles. However, for alternative \\napplications, some of the remaining capacity could still be utilised  as their requirements are lower \\nthan those of transportation.  One 2016 market research report forecast ed that  by 2025 , 29 GWh of \\nused EV batteries will become available . Of this, approximately  10 GWh will  be available for second \\nlife , stationary storage  applications  (BNEF 2016) . It is  likely that repurposed EV batteries will be \\ncheaper than new energy storage batteries. However, there will be trade -offs to consider such as \\ntesting, certification to a shorter life time than new batteries and ad dressing consumer concerns or \\nbiases against a second life product.  \\nHong Kong has government incentives to encourage and support the adoption of EV , such as tax \\nincentives, implementation of EV charging infrastructure, support for EV public transport and \\ngovernment procurement of EV. Coupled with forecast ed growth of EV , the government is  also \\nsupporting technology ideas for EV to energy storage. The Hong Kong government anticipates such \\na demand for this solution that they have run a competition for the b est ideas to convert EV \\nbatteries to energy storage technology  (Government of  Hong Kong 2017) .  \\nAs previously mentioned, the current adoption of EV in Australia is low  and  it is anticipated that EV \\non the road will continue to increase and is forecast ed to reach 425,000 by 2030 (Asghar 2016) . \\nRecent media announcements have shown a trend towa rds the adoption of solar and large -scale Figure 12 Waste Hierarchy.  \\n\\n30   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  grid storage batteries  in Australia . For example, the 100 MW storage project in South Australia is a \\nstrong signal that energy storage solutions are gaining traction within Australia.  \\nOne Australian company seeking  to capitalise on this opportunity is Relectrify , which is  a Melbourne -\\nbased  start -up company seeking  global opportunities in the area of battery reuse  and second life \\nbatteries. Relectrify technology optimises second life battery operation for EV to Energ y storage \\nsolutions. Relectrify were recently a finalist for the 2017 Hong Kong second life battery competition .  \\nOne of the challenges with the application of second life batteries is the lack of policy and protoc ols \\nor certification around the reuse  of b atteries for energy storage. Currently, consumers cannot be \\nassured that second life batteries will provide a standard and reliable life span, or are supplied f rom \\na certified and reliable manufacturer or distributer. Similarly, there is a question of how car \\nmanufacturers can be assured that their end -of-life battery product has been re -purposed with a \\nreliable reuse opportunity, and that the waste product from second life batteries are adequately \\nhandled and disposed. Irrespective of these concerns , the i ncreasing recognition of the  opportunity \\nto reuse  batteries by car manufacturers will continue to support this opportunity. A s in the future,  \\nthe number of EV on road and their subsequent end -of-life batteries  will also  increase. This option \\nis a viable fu ture opportunity, and the comparative life cycle for tradition al versus reuse is shown in \\nFigure 13.  \\n \\nFigure 13: Traditional (left) and reuse (right) life cycles for LIB  (reproduced from data in Ahmadi et al. 2014) . \\n7.5.2  Battery rejuvenation research  \\nNovel  scientific research into lithium battery rejuvenation or re -manufacture  is currently being \\ninvestigated  (for e.g. Wang et al. 2011; Gies 2015; Liu et al. 2016) . For example, o ne process involves \\n“bathing the cathode in a soft chemical solution to rejuvenate it”. This process is presented as bein g \\nmore cost effective  than battery recycling , as it pr events the cathode from needing to be rebuilt and \\nretains materials in their original form (Gies 2015) .   \\nBattery cell rejuvenation or re -manufacture seems to be  an overlooked research  and development  \\narea as it is presumed that once a product reaches end -of-life, the next logica l step is to move \\ndirectly to processing or recycling. There are also complexities with disassembly which could be \\naddressed by improved battery design and packaging to support battery rejuvenation.  \\nThe key scientific challenge is the removal of degraded materials and also removal of the solid \\nelectrolyte interphase layer . This  is formed during cycling from breakdown of electrolyte materials \\nwhich serves to protect the electrodes. As the SEI layer increases in size, the beneficial propertie s \\n\\nLithium b attery recycling in Australia   |  31 are reduced an d batteries start losing performance and capacity, eventually leading to cell end -of-\\nlife.  \\nA simpler rejuvenation concept is replacement of entire cells which have de graded in a larger \\nbattery pack systems. A direct swap out with new cells could in princi ple prolong the overall battery \\npack lifetime where degradation or failures due to a few cells have occurred rather than all cells \\nfailing. This concept requires that battery packs and systems be designed and constructed to enable \\nthis form of “servicing” to occur.  \\nGenerally speaking, t he best use of resources from a material and energy efficiency perspective is \\nreuse , before recycling.  This delays end -of-life  processing and prolong s the life of a cell, therefore \\nextending the original product life beyond the original manufactured timeframe. This research area \\nis indeed challenging  but deserves attention by industry , policy stakeholders  and the research \\ncommunity to attempt to retain resources in the productive economy for as long as possible. The \\nrejuvenation example and EV to energy storage are examples of this approach.  \\n \\n32   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  8 An international drive for resource recovery from \\nLIB  \\nThe development of technology for resource recovery from LIB  wastes in other countries around \\nthe world has largely been driven by policy and regulations that ban landfill disposal (of all waste s \\nin some countries, like Germany), set resource recovery targets from specific waste streams and \\nprovide incentive or pen alty  to manufacturers and distributers when they are not achieved. These \\nregulations, targets, incentives and penalties  drive innovation for technology development. The \\nwaste management and product stewardship landscape are  in transition , with more focus o n \\npriority waste  streams , and diversion of these from landfill . Unfortunately, Australia by comparison \\ndoes not have as comprehensive policy and regulation that specifically addresses LIB or LIB waste  \\nand infrastructure  specifically for LIB recycling in Au stralia is absent . This chapter  review s the \\ninternational regulatory landscape and compare s it to that in Australia .  \\n8.1 International regulations for resource recovery  \\nIn terms of global transport, LIB and LIB waste is classified as Dangerous Goods. Despite this , there \\nis significant country to country variability in the environmental management of end-of-life LIB , and \\nthis is supported by a raft of policies and regulations that differ from country to country . Europe an \\ncountries such as Germany are  the most advanced region in tracking, capturing and diverting all \\nwastes (including e-waste ) from landfill, while Korea imports e-waste and other wastes as a \\nresource, focussing more on the development of an economically viable recycling industry.   \\n8.1.1  Europe  \\nA number of internationally recognised treaties and conventions, including the Basel, Stockholm, \\nand Rotterdam Conventions, have been ratified to control the movement of hazardous wastes \\nacross borders, with some specific references to the control of hand ling, distributing, movement \\nand treatment of e-waste  and waste batteries. For the most part, these conventions regulate the \\nmovement of hazardous wastes from developed countries to less developed countries , where costs \\nassociated with disposal and treatme nt are lower, and regulations surrounding the disposal and \\nrecovery of resources from these wastes may be less developed and more flexible in their \\napplication.  \\nIn order to promote resource recovery and closed loop processing for new LIB using recovered \\nmaterials, regulations and policies now exist in parts of the world that control the handling, dispos al, \\nmanagement and recovery of resources from e-wastes, including LIB waste . The most significant \\nlegislation is the Batteries Directive, which was introduc ed by the European Union in 2006 (Directive \\n2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council). This directive was intended to protect, \\npreserve and improve the quality of the environment by reducing the increasingly negative impact \\nof batteries and  accumulators, as well as the waste batteries and accumulators that are produced.  \\nThe Batteries directive had the following mandates:  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  33 Collection rates had to reach 25 % and 45 % by 2012 and 2016, respectively;  \\n\\uf0b7 Recycling of battery and accumulator content to produce similar products or for other \\npurposes was to be 65 % (by weight) for le ad acid batteries, 75 % of nickel -cadmium  \\nbatteries and ac cumulators (including as much lead  recycling as feasible from these), 50 \\n% of all other battery and accumulator typ es;  \\n\\uf0b7 Prohibition of disposal of industrial/automotive batteries/accumulators to landfill or \\nincineration; and,  \\n\\uf0b7 Allowing the recycling and treatment to happen outside EU, provided EU legislation for \\ntransport/transfer of hazardous waste was followed.  \\nReports  indicated that the 2012 targets were met by most EU members, but the 2016 target was \\ntoo ambitious, with definitions being a bit subjective and measuring tools not providing accurate \\ndata  (Recycling International 2013) . In 2014, only 7 member states had achieved the 2016 target of \\n45 %, and four member countries were yet to reach the 2012 target of 25 % (EUWID Recycling and \\nWaste Management 2016) . \\n8.1.2  United States of America  \\nIn the US A, LIB  are considered to be hazardous and are regulated under the Standards for Universal \\nWaste Management (Electronic Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 273, US EPA). This \\nregulation mandates that waste batteries can be collected as hazardous wastes fo r further \\ntreatment and/or recycling, and prohibits the disposal of some nickel -cadmium, mercury -containing \\nand small , sealed lead batteries to landfill, instead encouraging the recycling of these particular \\nbatteries. However, the Federal Government stand ards do not include any directive targeted at \\nresource recovery from LIB waste, with some states in the US A developing their own state -based \\nregulations that enforce producers to offer or fund battery recycling . These schemes are active  in \\nCalifornia, Minn esota, Iowa New York, Florida, Vermont, New Jersey and Maryland (Call2Recycle \\nUSA 2017) . In addition to these, most states have regulations focussed on the rec ycling of lead acid, \\nsmall nickel -cadmium  and other batteries that are regulated at the Federal level for disposal (e.g. \\nTexas, Utah, and Michigan) . \\n8.1.3  Canada  \\nIn Canada, extended product stewardship regulations exist in British Columbia under the \\nEnvironmental Management Act (Recycling Regulation; B.C. Reg 449/2004) , which mandates that \\nobligated parties (manufacturers, sellers/distributers and importers) must have an approved \\nproduct stewardship plan in place in order to prevent pollution due to the  production of wastes, \\nincluding primary and rechargeable batteries (Schedule 3, Electrical and Ele ctronic Product \\nCategory). The A ct called for a total recovery rate of 75 % of all goods defined, and as a result of the \\nAct, Call2Recycle set increasing tar gets for battery recovery, from 12 % in 2010 to 40 % in 2012 (CM \\nConsulting 2012) . The other Canadian provinces have hazardous material product stewardship \\nregulations in place, but none of them mandate recovery targets. Though the reg ulation is specific \\nto British Columbia, Call2Recycle Canada operates an approved product stewardship program in all \\nCanadian provinces (Call2Recycle Canada 2017) .   \\n34   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  8.1.4  China  \\nChina us the largest consumer of electronics and produce s the highest number of LIB when \\ncompared to other developed countries. However, regulations for the management of LIB waste are \\nnot very well deve loped, and as of 2015, no national or regional regulations exist ed to promote the  \\nrecovery of resources from LIB waste  (Zeng, Li & Liu 2015) . In 2017, China announced a general ban \\non global imports of waste products into the country  (Lasker et al. 2017) . The full impact of these \\nimport bans is yet to be seen, but it is  already having an  effect  on the global waste management  \\nindustry , resulting in a push for more detailed waste and materials tracking, improved collect ion \\nand sorting, and  innovation for local recycling and resource recovery from all wastes, including LIB \\nwaste .  \\n8.1.5  Japan  \\nIn Japan, the Law for the Promotion of the Effective Utilisation of Resources (2000) mandates that \\nrechargeable batteries are classified  for recycling at the manufacturing stage  using a standardised \\nthree arrow recycling mark indicating battery ty pe and primary metal components. When they \\nreach their end -of-life, t hese marked batteries  are then  collected and recycled  appropriately  \\n(Battery Association of  Japan 2010a) . The L aw also sets a LIB  recycling target of greater than 3 0 % \\nand  stipulates that all manufacturers and importers of batteries must have a recovery system for \\nwaste products. The Japan Portable Rechargeable Battery Recycling Centre (JBRC)  was formed as \\npart of the Battery Association of Japan to provide free collection and recycling of portable \\nrechargeable batteries sold across the country  (Battery Association of Japan 2010b) . \\n8.1.6  Korea  \\nThe People’s Democratic Republic of Korea is a leading manufacturer, exporter and consumer of \\nLIB , bein g home to both Samsung and LG Chem who are the largest battery manufacturers in the \\nworld  (Chung & Sungwoo 2011) . However, Korea has limited natural mineral and energy resources, \\nand as such relies on  the trade of waste, import ing wastes from other countries and utilising \\nsecondary resources to drive their resources industry. Imported w aste (regardless of its \\nclassification) is regulated by the Act on Transboundary Movement of Waste and its Treatment \\n(ATW) , which outlines the do mestic implementation of the Basel Convention  in Korea . The import \\nand export of various waste streams are recorded by Import/Export Approval and Declaration \\nSystems (IEAS and IEDS), w hich are  regulated under the Act on Waste Management (AWM). In the \\nearly  2000s, the primary waste import s for Korea were  waste batteries, waste cable, lead scrap and \\nsludge (3,862 t onnes  over 6 import transactions). How ever, the volume of imports has  grown \\nsubstantially, with 1,338,140 t onnes  of waste imported in 2008, primari ly consisting of waste \\nbatteries (including nickel -cadmium,  LIB and lead acid  batteries ) and printed circuit boards. The \\nincrease in trade volume underpins the development of regulation in waste trade for Korea, as well \\nas the revision of both the ATW and AWM (Chung & Sungwoo 2011) . Similarly, this increase in \\nimport volumes has driven technology development and business opportunities surrounding the \\nrecovery of resources from waste products, and as such, Korea is leading in the f ield of resource \\nrecovery and the utilisation of secondary materials.   \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  35 8.2 Australian p olicy, regulation and stewardship schemes  \\n8.2.1  Product Stewardship Act, 2011  \\nIn 2011, the  Federal Government  Product Stewardship Act was established as a means of managing \\nthe environmental, health and safety impacts of products outlined on the approved product list, \\nspecifically focussed on the impacts surrounding the disposal of these products. The Act \\nacknowledged the shared responsibility for managing wastes and their impact  throughout the \\nproduct life cycle, and put in place a framework of voluntary  (through industry self -regulation and \\ngovernment influenced quasi -regulation) , co -regulatory  (whereby industry develops and \\nadministers its own arrangements, but government provi des legislative backing to enable the \\narrangements)  and direct government regulation of  product stewardship guidelines to promote \\nrecycling and recovery of value from waste products.  \\nWaste  lead acid batteries and e-waste from televisions and computers are  both collected and \\nrecycled under co -regulatory agreement s as defined by the Act , known as the National Television \\nand Computer R ecycling Scheme (NTCRS) . In 2016,  the Department of Energy and Environment \\n(DEE)  include d battery waste, photovoltaic cells and e-waste  from other sources not currently \\nincluded in the NTCRS on the Approved Product L ist of the  Product Stewardship Act (Department of \\nEnergy and Environment Australia 2016) . However,  at time of writing  it is yet to be detailed how the \\nproduct stewardship of these wastes will be developed or regulated.  \\nProduct stewardship for waste batteries and e-waste  also occurs at a State and Local Government \\nAuthorities (LGA) level in Australia. Many states have their own regulations and rules pertaining to  \\nthe collection, transfer and recycling of e-waste  and batteries . H owever , the development of \\nmandatory re source recovery programs is still in its infancy. Previously, State Govern ments \\nmanaged their own e -waste collection programs, but the programs such as the Western Australian \\nTransitional E -waste Program (WA Waste Authority 2014)  were replaced with  the NTCRS, which \\nprohibited the disposal of some computer and television -derived e -wastes to landfill and now \\ncontrols the management, diversion and recycling of these wastes at a Federal level. South Australia \\nis currently the only State Government that completely bans the disposal of all e-waste types to \\nlandfill  (Zero Waste SA 2017) . In 2015, Victoria was discussing the implementation of a landfill \\ndisposal ban for e-waste (DELWP 2015) . In  New South Wales, the Environmental Protection Agency \\n(EPA) and Environmental Trust funded innovative research targeting the development of new \\nrecycling infrastructure solutions and establish the  recycled materials market in the state through \\nresearch and development, with specific focus on the recycled and recovery of value from problem \\nwastes such as e-waste  (NSW EPA 2017) . Western Australia has few  regulations developed with \\nregard to e-waste  management, but  a voluntary program called the Hazardous Household Wastes \\nprogram enables residents to drop off unwanted household che micals and hazardous wastes \\n(including some kinds of batteries) at no charge. However, this program specifically excludes e-\\nwastes  and  waste LIB  (WA Waste Authority 2017) . \\n8.2.2  Classification of LIB  and batteries  \\nLIB and their waste pose significant risk to safety and human and environmental health if not \\nhandled, managed and disposed of in a correct manner. P ostage and shipping of LIB or LIB that are \\n36   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  contained within a device are subject to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) \\nDangerous Goods Regulations. They must be packaged and labelled appropriately. All courier \\ncompanies (e.g. FedEx, Austral ia Post) have detailed instructions pertaining to safe transport of LIB . \\nInternational packages are subject to the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. Road transport is \\nsubject to the Special Provision 188 of the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerou s Goods \\nby Road and Rail. This provision limits the number of batteries per package, and outlines packaging \\nand labelling requirements.  \\n8.2.3  Self -regulation by industry  \\nMobileMuster is one of the largest  Australian examples  of a voluntary regulated  recycling  program . \\nA levy is added to each phone sold  in Australia , giving  manufacturers some responsibility  for  product \\nstewardship for mobile phones at the  end -of-life. One big threat to this model is ‘ free riders ’, where \\nbrand owners are not members of MobileMus ter but their phone models are able to be collected \\nby MobileMuster and are effectively subsided by other member brands. For example, Apple never \\njoined MobileMuster in Australia, instead relying upon their own recycling initiatives. Sony and LG \\nhave both left the program in recent years and this contributed to decrease d revenues  to \\nMobileMuster , decreasing by $1.67 million between 2007 -08 and  2014 -15 (Read 2015) . \\nABRI is a not -for -profit entity and established in 2008 as the peak body  in Australia for working w ith \\nindustry, government and the community to promote and eliminate batteries being disposed to \\nlandfill. ABRI is  working to improve the collection, infrastructure and policy agenda for battery \\nrecycling in Australia (ABRI 2017) . However , to date, battery manufacturers, recyclers and \\ngovernment have not managed to implement a similar program to MobileMuster  for the collection \\nand recycling of LIB . Handhel d batteries were listed on the 2013 -14 product list of the Product \\nStewardship Act 2011 as a priority product for development of stewardship arrangements (O’Farrell \\net al. 2014) . An ABRI -led  handheld battery implementation working group  continues to scope  a \\nvoluntary and  industry led product stewardship scheme  (O’Farrell et al. 2014) . To date, an agreed \\nscheme is yet to  be implemented but has State and Territory support evidenced by a 2017 meeting \\nof Australia’s Environment Ministers which re sulted in agreement to consider battery stewardship \\napproaches which may involve a  regulatory option to support a voluntary battery recycling scheme \\n(Australian Government 2017a) . \\n \\n \\nLithium battery recycling  in Australia   |  37 Part  III  \\nDrivers for a developing \\nindustry    \\nIdentification of gaps, challenges and opportunities through the eyes \\nof the stakeholders  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n38   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  9 Methodology  \\nIn order to better  understand the status , direction and challenges for  LIB battery recycling in \\nAustralia, CSIRO contacted and interviewed six key  stakeholders  with roles associated with end of \\nlife LIB . Through f ormal stakeholder interviews and informal engagement by author attendance at \\nindustry workshops, conferences and other industry events, qualitative data was  gathered to \\ndetermine stakeholder  perspectives  relating to the challenges and opportunities for Australia in \\ndeveloping an onshore recycling program for LIB  waste . \\nThe semi -structured, q ualitative interviewing was undertaken in an inductive approach to un cover \\ntopics most frequently cited and strategic themes that may not be adequately covered by the \\nliterature (Williams & Lewis 2005) . Interview d ata was captured in 2017 , with ethics approval from \\nthe  CSIRO Ethics committee. As there were a relatively low number of interviews ca ptured, it may \\nnot be possible to generalise the research findings across the entire sector.   However, interviewing \\nis a high -quality data capture method and these findings represent information from battery end -\\nof-life stakeholders within Australia.  While  the count of interviews is small, it is important to \\nrecognise that the Australian LIB recycling sector is small and the  interviews capture 43 % of the LIB \\nrecycling and collection industry, based on the ABRI website list of industry participants  (ABRI 2018) . \\nIn addition,  to counter the low number of in -depth industry interviews, the  captured  data w as \\ncomplemented by discussion  with stakeholders  as part of CSIRO ’s broader industry engagement . \\nThis provide s a more generalised inform ation baseline . All industry feedback has been de -identified \\nin accordance with CSIRO ethics approval.  \\nInterview data was  initially captured in note form,  then major points were c oded into PESTLE \\ncategories (Political, Economic, Social, Technical, Environm ental  and Legal ), further coded to  \\nindicat e either a positive or negative overall business impact. PESTLE analysis is most useful for \\nstrategic analysis where the lead driver is to understand the external environment. An example of \\nthe PESTLE framework  is shown in Table 7.  Data were also loaded into NVIVO, a qualitative data \\nanalysis software package, to code and evaluate the frequency of common themes.  Finally, c ommon \\nthemes were supplemented with desktop sources literature, where required. Due to a low nu mber \\nof Legal items being raised, results are reported in the PESTE format ; combing legal with political \\nthemes (i.e.  regulation and  policy ). \\nTable 7 PESTLE Framework used for all stakeholder interviews  \\n Political  Economic  Social  Technical  Environmental  Legal  \\nOpportunities (+ve)        \\nBusiness impact        \\nIssues ( -ve)        \\nBusiness impact        \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  39 10 Policy and regulatory drivers  \\nInterview data suggested that the  lack of pol icy was a serious gap for reuse  or recycling  of LIB waste . \\nAll participants agreed that Australia had a moral obligation to directly manage its own waste and \\nthis necessitated a domestic processing option. Some participants proposed that Australia had an \\nopportunity to be a leader in the Asia -Pacific region for battery processing, noting that New Zealand \\nsends its batteries to Singapore for processing. However, a full assessment of economic drivers and \\nchallenges is required to support the development of the industry .  \\nAs evidenced by international examples, p olicy levers have the potential to radically change the \\nnature of how Australia deals with end -of-life batteries. For example, p olicy to support greater \\nadoption of EV , the provision of  incentives for EV  purchase , the removal of import taxes or \\ninstallation o f widespread EV infrastructure, would have a significant boost to the adoption of EV  in \\nAustralia. This would  in turn  increase the stock and security of second -life  and end -of-life  EV \\nbatteries  that would require recycling and resource recovery . In Australia batteries are identified on \\nthe product list for consideration in the Product Stewardship Scheme. This is a requirement to \\nindicate to industry and the community that batteries are being considered for regulation or \\naccreditation. Policy that identifies batteries as a priority waste stream or banning batteries going \\nto landfill would also result in meaningful increases to stock levels. However, as one participant \\nnoted, landfill bans could also result in an increase of illegal dumping and subse quent contamination \\nof the environment or risk to human health.  \\nInterview data also suggested greatest support for a voluntary program, modelled on the successful \\nMobileMuster program for mobile phones. This option is also the cheapest for government , rat her \\nthan managing a fully -regulated recycling scheme . Participants suggested that handheld batteries \\nare the most likely initial LIB product to be managed in a scheme.   \\n10.1.1  Australian standards, certifications or protocols  \\nThere are a lack of standards or pro tocols in a number of areas for LIB , and this is a concern for all \\nsta ges of the life cycle. When importing,  consumers presume that products c ontaining batteries are \\nfit-for -use. However, there are a number of ‘aftermarket’ brands  (i.e. products manufactur ed after \\nthe sale of the original product)  that may be of a lower quality  with  poor performance and higher \\nsafety risk s associated with them  than more reputable brands. One of the  improvements following \\nthe ‘exploding’ battery issue associated with Samsung  products , was the recent announcement  of \\na new 8 -point standardised  battery testing protocol. Samsung also made their battery testing \\nprotocols publicly available  (Samsung 2018) .  \\nThere  are gaps in  international standard s for testing or certification of batteries in consumer \\nproducts.   Examples of protocol gaps presented by participants were standard protocols for battery \\ntesting, certification of batter y quality and fit -for -purpose, certification of batteries for reuse (such \\nas EV to home storage), certification of EV batteries for reuse following a vehicle crash, protocols  \\nfor attending LIB fire (home or vehicle), and protocols for safely discharging of  batteries at end -of-\\nlife.  \\n40   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  Similarly, the gaps in  of standards also makes second -life , reuse , recycling of and resource recovery \\nfrom  these batteries more difficult, where quality and safety of re -manufactured batteries cannot \\nbe verified, and discharging of batteries prior to processing is not standardised.  \\nThe lack of testing and certification protocols presents consumer and business risk and safety \\nconcerns. However, it also presents an opportunity for companies to fill the gap by developing and \\ntesting against Australian protocols.  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  41 11 Economic considerations  \\nInterview participants noted the important role of product owners or importers for the \\nresponsibility for battery waste at end -of-life. Most participants suggested that as manufacturers \\nwere the original owners of the product , and therefore the originating  cause of Australia’s landfill \\nproblem and future liability, they should pa y for recycling at end -of-life or include recycling \\ntreatment costs in their product pricing. This concept of product s tewardship has increasing \\nacceptance following the implementat ion of the Product Stewardship Act in 2011. Involving \\nmanufacturers in addressing end -of-life processing is also the model that has been implemented fo r \\nmobile phones in Australia. Therefore,  the concept of OEMs being responsible for the management \\nof end -of-life  products  has a precedent .  \\n11.1   Transport Costs  \\nOther economic issues raised by the participants were the costs associated with the  import and \\nexport of battery waste. Export permit costs are increasingly viewed as prohibitive despite the \\nDepartment of  Environment stating  that  fees are set solely by the time required to process an \\napplication. The expense of export permit licences wa s approximately  $ 8,000, increasing to $ \\n13,000 as of 1 July, 2017  (Australian Government 2017b) . The cost of import permits is a deterrent \\nto Australia processing regi onal LIB waste even though there is potential to import from Asia and \\nPacific Islands, including New Zealand. This is a barrier to Australia becoming a regional LIB \\nprocessing hub as it builds infrastructure to process domestic waste. One participant not ed (as at \\n2017) it is currently cheaper for  batteries from New Zealand to be sent to Singapore than to \\nAustralia.  \\n11.2   Security of supply  \\nSecurity of waste supply was also a driver for considering the economics associated with developing \\na local LIB recycling industry. Currently, Australia only produces a relatively low volume of LIB waste, \\nand in combination with poor collection rates  (less than 2 %) , the economic feasibility of processing \\noptions was questioned  by participants . It was generally acknowledged t hat social issues , such as \\nthe  lack of collection infrastructure and community awareness of where to take end of life batteries , \\nis the primary cause of a lack of suffici ent volumes and ongoing supply of waste feedstock. T his  has \\na big impact on the market  subsequently not being re ady to invest in infrastructure . If the available \\nstocks were collected for recycling, as opposed to being sent to landfill, then this would result in  \\nindustry having confidence to invest in processing infrastructure.  \\n11.3   Loss of po tentially valuable  resources  \\nParticipants also noted the potential valuable resources arising from battery waste  including metals, \\nplastics and graphite . It was suggested that s ome raw materials arising from battery processing  are \\n42   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  not available here in Aus tralia , and there was recognition that some of t he secondary materials \\nrecovered from LIB waste  may be able to find niche manufacturing markets .  \\n11.4   The high cost of collection and transport  \\nIn addition to low waste volumes, the cost of collection and transp ort ha ve also been identified as \\na major contributor to the economic  feasibility  of domestic processing , especially in Australia which \\nconsists of small, wide ly dispersed population centres. Through visiting our South Korean \\ncounterparts in mid -2017, it wa s noted that in South Korea the collection and transport of e -waste \\nand spent batteries contributes up to 50 % of their overall processing costs.  High domestic transport \\ncosts are a driver for developing mobile processing infrastructure for Australia. Ther e was strong \\nsupport by participants for Australia to develop and implement mobile processing infrastructure as \\nthis is the most suitable for Australian conditions.  \\nIn addition  to the complexity and heterogeneous nature of the waste, the requirement for, a nd cost \\nof, manual handling and sorting of the battery waste  also presents challenges for recycling this \\nwaste. T he consistent and constant supply of the waste product for processing, variability in \\ncommodity prices, as well as the cost of collection and transport of waste to the processing facilit y \\neach  also  influence the feasibility of realising increased domestic processing.  \\n11.5   Economic modelling and  information gaps  \\nIt was acknowledged by the participants that industry would always seek the lowest cost processing \\noption , and currently the benchmark is the export market price for processing. During the interview \\nproc ess , it was suggested that economic modelling of options to understand the impact of various \\npolicy and socio -economic levers would be very useful in understanding the correct approach for \\nAustralia.  Defining what happens to LIB waste volumes under various  conditions such as b an of \\nexports by no longer issuing export permits , all batteries exported for processing , or implementation \\nof a full LIB P roduct Ste wardship scheme , would help  to address knowledge  gaps . This type of \\neconomic evaluation would better i nform industry stakeholders prior to investment in this \\ndeveloping industry.  \\n \\n \\n  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  43 12 Social Considerations  \\nMuch of the end -of-life  battery stock  collected in Australia  is exported for recycling. The issue with \\nglobal recycling is that waste can potentially be  exported to developing countries with less stringent \\nsocial and environmental controls for  processing waste s. All participants  were  unanimous  in stating  \\nthat Australia had a  moral  obligation to process its own waste. All participants believed that LI B \\nwaste  would event ually be processed domestically. However,  a key challenge for Australia to \\nimprove the  recovery of LIB wastes and diversion from landfill  is the lack of consumer awareness of \\nthe environmental damage LIB waste can  cause , and where LIB  can be dropped off for recycling. \\nCurrently, some retail companies accept lithium batteries for free, but this is not well known \\namongst consumers.  \\n12.1   Consumer behaviour  \\nAmongst interview participants, the lack of consumer awareness of recycling opportunities wa s \\nstated as the single most important barrier preventing increased collection of end -of-life batteries. \\nConsumer education of the environmental impacts of batteries, the importance of not sending \\nbatteries to landfill, and availa ble options for recycling a re some  of the biggest hurdles for the \\nbattery recycling sector. The  current option for disposal  of LIB  is currently  free , whereby consumers \\ncan place this waste in a municipal waste bin . Any future collection and recycling option s may \\ninvolve a cost and p lacing the recycling cost onto the consumer will be a further barrier for collection \\nat end -of-life. Coupled with a likely ban of batteries to landfill, these factors may result in illegal \\ndisposal of batteries which is highly undesirable due to the enviro nmental and human health risks \\nthat incorrect handling and disposal pose.  \\nMobileMuster has had a big focus on addressing consumer education of their mobile phone \\nrecycling options. Their efforts have comprised of working with schools, social media campaign s and \\nworking with charities to increase the number of mo bile phones being collected and  recycled. As a \\nconsequence of their efforts, fewer people are disposing of their phone s to landfill. Over the ten -\\nyear period  from  2005 -2010 , the proportion of landfil led mobile phones has  decreased from 9 % to \\n2 %  (Read 2015) . This has been achieved through a dedicated program of education , coupled with \\nfreely available disposal units dispersed across the country . Mobile p hone sto ckpiling  remains a \\nproblem with 40 -60 % of p eople stating they retain their phone as they would like a spare or backup \\nphone. Despite this challenge , there has been a small increase in the likelihood of people recycling \\ntheir old mobile phone from 25 % to 35 % since 2006  (see Figure 14).  \\n44   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia   \\nFigure 14: Likelihood of recycling a mobile phone (Read 2015 , p.32 ) \\n12.2   Industry guidelines - transport  \\nThe p articipants acknowledged that there is a need for plain language, best practice guidelines for \\nthe transport of end -of-life LIB, applicable to the Australian market. Domestic transport is currently \\nrequired in Australia to collect batteries for export or o nshore processing . The interview s revealed \\nthat different recyclers have different interpretations of transport rules. For example, some \\ncompanies wrap the entire battery in tape to protect the anode and cathode during transport in an \\nattempt to reduc e the  risk of fire or explosion, whereas other companies do not.  Both the packaging \\nand downstream processing are  labour intensive  and  cost ly. Compounding this issue is inconsistent \\nlabelling of battery types during domestic transport.  This  is evidence of an  emerging market where \\nconsistent processes have not yet been implemented across the industry . The issue of confusion \\nfrom the transport industry on safe road travel for end of life LIB  was also noted in a recent report \\n(Lewis 2016) . These issues are likely  a consequence of low levels of LIB waste currently being \\ncaptured. However consistent and safe d omestic transport practices will become increasingly  \\nimportant as  Australia n e-waste landfill bans are rolled out across Australia, higher volumes of end -\\nof-life LIB are collected and  domestic facilitie s upscale and commence processing larger quantities \\nof LIB.  \\n \\n\\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  45 13 Technical Factors  \\nA number of technical factors were raised as a result of discussions with participants , includ ing  \\npractical issues such as safe discharge of batteries prior to processing or tra nsport for export , and \\nadequate labelling to ensure the proper handling of batteries. Many participants supported the idea \\nof mobile processing facilities suitable for Australia’s distributed population , but suitable technology \\nfor LIB recycling in Austral ia has yet to be determined .  \\n13.1   Labelling  \\nThe difficulty of identifying LIB chemistry due to a lack of adequate industry labelling was noted by \\nmost industry participants as a major concern for safety and processing. Although there was some \\ndifference of opinion here , some participants agreed that improved labelling would help with \\nsorting . However,  as there are  currently no industry standard s, recyclers need to adopt alternative  \\nand boutique  practices to sort batteries. It was also  acknowledged that given  the long service life of \\nsome batteries , physical labelling would need to withstand an in -use period , and this may present \\nchallenges to OEMs . Sorting is currently possible under existing labelling conditions and this was a n \\nissue  that could be successful ly managed by adequate staff training to recognise different battery \\nchemistries.  For example, a ll batteries carried clear voltage labelling and battery chemistry could be \\ndeduced from voltage or battery product shape and size . In the absence of suitable l abelling, training \\nand education was currently overcoming this problem in the short -term. Labelling  may not be an \\nacceptable solution for larger scale collection and processing.  \\n13.2   Fire and Safety Risk  \\nThe safety and fire risk associated with the transport a nd processing of batteries was acknowledged \\nby most participants as a  key  issue . There have been a number of in -use  and transportation  aviation \\nfires  (Cavanagh, Behrens, et al. 2015)  and LIB can cause fires even when disposed to landfill \\n(O’Farrell et al.  2014; Heelan et al. 2016b) . LIB have been known to be accidentally mixed into the \\nlead acid battery recycling stream as a result of the lack of clear labelling. Once LIB reach the input \\nstream of lead smelters, this poses a serious danger and has resulted in fires and explosions. This \\ncan occur as a consequence of mixed loads of batteries delivered to recyclers, but the risk could be  \\nreduc ed if there was an economic incentive for processing LIB, which would promote collection and \\nsorting prior to processing (Gaines 2014) . It is imperative that the  potential contamination of \\nrecycling streams is addressed. An effective labelling or sorting process would address t his issue \\nwhich extends responsibility back to battery manufacturers for appropriate labelling, to the \\nregulatory bodies to enforce standardised labelling, and to recyclers for implementing an adequate \\nsorting system.  \\nOne participant raised the example of a significant fire in the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka that was \\nattr ibuted to Australian LIB cargo e n route  to Belgium for processing. This spontaneous fire burned \\nfor 5 days before it could be extinguished. The investigation report has resulted in the shi pping \\ncompany involved in the incident no longer accepting waste or recycled LIB  for transport  (BEA Mer \\n46   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  2017) . This outcome could have major repercussions for global shipping transport as options for \\nfreighting end -of-life batteries may be significantly reduced due to the potential hazard and fire risk \\nthreat of LIB. The safety and fire risk s also have the  potential to impact on Australia as it is possible \\nthat new regulations or decisions by transport companies to n o longer accept waste LIB may force \\nAustralia to process LIB domestically rather than continue to rely on export for processing.  \\n13.3   Battery discharge  \\nRecycling of LIB presents unique safety and handling issues . If LIB are stored without proper \\ndischarge, th ere is potential for them to short circuit unintentionally which would potentially lead \\nto a fire. It is important that LIB  should be discharged or decommissioned by a trained and licenced \\npersonnel (Lewis 2015) . An alternative deactivation approach  is a thermal pre -treatment  where \\nbatteries are heated to a maximum of  300 degrees . This opens the battery cells and combusts \\nsolvents  which  render s the battery ina ctive  (Diekmann et al. 2017) . As referenced by a stakeholder \\nparticipant, the discharge process is even more cumbersome for compromised EV LIB where  one \\nindustry guideline  recommend s soaking the  entire vehicle up to tyre height in a bath of water for \\n72 hours. This results in potentially dangerous h ydrogen emissions and the treatment water \\nbecoming industrial waste (Mitsubishi Motor s 2013) . This example illustrates why i mproved \\nmethods  and procedures  for discharging EV batteries are  desirable . Moreover , a standardised pack \\nconstruction method that allows  simple  disassembly at end -of-life  is also desirable .   \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  47 13.4   Pre -process ing of batteries  \\nFollowing their discharge, pre -processing of the \\nbatteries is required prior to the  recovery of the \\nvaluable components. This pre -processing consists \\nof sorting into similar battery chemistries then \\nseparating the graphite and lithium cathode from \\nthe copper or aluminium material.  \\nFigure 15 shows an unwrapped “Jelly Roll” , where \\nthe anode is on the left with copper and a graphite \\nsurface. The cathode of aluminium with the NMC \\nor LCO coating is positioned on the right. Given the \\nanode and cathode are manufactu red so the \\ngraphite and lithium -based materials remain fixed \\nto th e electrode, separation of these materials \\nfrom the metals is a technical challenge , and this \\nwas identified by some of the interview \\nparticipants . Improvements in the separation of \\nmaterials to develop a pure resource stream from \\na pre -processing  treatmen t process would directly \\nimprove  the  economic benefits of recycling.  \\n \\n \\n13.5   Circular economy  \\nThere is growing interest in the various  business \\nmodels provided by the circular economy for \\nAustralia. A recently published South Australian \\nreport estimated the c ircular economy would result \\nin an increase of 25,000 jobs and a 27  % decrease in \\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to a \\nbusiness as usual scenario (Lifecycles 2017) . Lithium \\nmining in Aust ralia is an emerging area with good \\ngrowth prospects. There have also been media \\nreports of a proposed lithium battery factory in \\nDarwin (Daly 2017) .  \\nRecycling companies could explore partnerships \\nwith mining companies to ascertain any \\ncomplementary infrastructure or capability. This is \\nthe proposed approach one mining organisation in \\nWA is in the process of undertaking. Moreover, the \\nproduction of  any value -added products by Figure 15: Typical LIB “Jelly Roll” unwrapped \\nshowing graphite anode (left) and cathode (right). \\nUnderlying copper foil (left) and aluminium foil \\n(right current collectors can be seen where coatings \\nhave been removed during disassembly.  \\nFigure 16: Potential circular economy model for lithium \\nbatteries.  \\n\\n48   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  recyclers for manufacturers is another opportunity. These are examples of c onnecting three sectors \\nof LIB recyclers, lithium miners and advanced manufacturers  (Figure 16 ) and these upstream and \\ndownstream supply chain connections are  a key part of commencing  circular economy discussions \\nand identifying further value add opportunities from LIB  waste in Australi a.  \\n13.6   Distributed waste processing  \\nThe rise of the circular economy supports new opportunities with alternative business models. The \\ndistribution of waste across Australia results in collection issues, the chief of which is the cost of \\nlogistics and transpo rt of waste for processing. To directly combat the high transport costs, Australia \\ncould adopt a mobile, flexible, small scale recycling process. In this model  proposed by participants , \\nwaste discharging, sorting and dismantling could occur locally, and th e processing infrastructure \\ncould travel to key locations across Australia, instead of the waste resources travelling to key \\ninfrastructure sites. The success of such a model would still require certainty in the collection an d \\nlocal stockpiling options for  LIB during periods when the processing infrastructure is absent.  \\nAlternatively, having a larger processing facility with the capacity to do both local and internatio nal \\nLIB recycling could help offset local transport costs.  \\nIf there is greater availabilit y of processed resources within Australia, this then enables a truly closed \\nloop manufacturing process to occur with the domestic utilisation of recovered metals and \\nresources rather than export of waste and import of resources or products. There is potent ial for a \\ndisruptive process es or technologies such as additive manufacturing to be a trigger for utilising \\nrecovered resources from waste products, and equally enable small -scale, distributed \\nmanufacturing within Australia (Giurco et al. 2014) . These strategies are examples of the circular \\neconomy in Australia.  \\n13.7   Lack of information and data  \\nParticipants suggested tha t there was not adequate data available which would support investment \\ninto infrastructure. Certainly, there is a lack of adequate data for the waste sector making this \\ncomplaint understandable. Furthermore, the recycling industry has not had a history of investment \\nin research and development to the same level as mining in Australia (Giurco et al. 2014)  and it is \\nunc lear if more reliable data will improve t hat situation. Research i nvestment to address these \\ninformation gaps has already occurred by various industry, State and Federal groups, but interview \\nparticipants proposed a number of outstanding information gaps, including:  \\n\\uf0b7 Economic modelling and cost -benefit analysis based on scenarios for policy changes, landfill \\nbans, export/import restrictions. This modelling will provide the recycling industry with \\nadequate confidence in the number of available end -of-life  han dheld batteries;  \\n\\uf0b7 Life cycle assessment (LCA) on the benefits of converting end -of-life EV batteries to \\nresidential  or commercial energy storage , as  compared to recycling;  \\n\\uf0b7 Information regarding  the best existing recycling technology for Australian condition s, \\nincluding the  identification of t he best equipment f or use on different battery chemistries, \\nscale mobility and flexibility of technology, use of existing mineral processing technology, \\nand transport and pre -processing options; and,  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  49 \\uf0b7 A best practice guid e for battery recycling for Australian consumers and  stakeholders.  \\n \\n14 Environmental  issues  \\nDuring the interviews, there was little focus on the  environme ntal issues associated with LIB waste, \\nas it was commonly accepted that batteries pose an unacceptable environmental and human health \\nrisk when disposed to landfill.  This is well -acknowledged in academic literature (Zeng et al. 2014; \\nAral & Vecchio -Sadus 2008) . Waste LIB  are currently classified as Dangerous Goods , not a hazardous  \\nwaste  (Randell et al. 2014) , but they have the potential to leach toxic materials  into the environment  \\nas well as posing fire risks if punctured or short circuited . This is then exacerbated when non -LIB  are \\ndisposed into landfill where additional risks from mercury, lead or cadmium leaching into the \\nenvironment/waterways also exists. There are current indu stry procedures to contain leaking \\nbatteries  when they are detected . One participant gave an example of a compromised and leaking  \\nmobile phone battery  where  proper landfill disposal requires first wrapping it in a plastic bag and \\nthen containing it within concrete in order to prevent environmental damage from occurring. This \\nonerous process is indicative of the potential hazard LIB pose to the environment. All interview \\nparticipants were unanimous that landfill was an unacceptable option for batteries and A ustralia \\nshould adopt domestic solutions  for processing end -of-life LIB .  \\n50   |  Lithium battery  recycling in Australia  Part IV   \\nSummary  \\nConclusions and key findings  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  51 15 Conclusion s and key findings  \\n15.1   Conclusion s \\nLithium battery recycling is an emerging industry in Australia. Currently, less than 2 % of this was te \\nis collected and exported overseas for resource recovery, while the majority of the waste is still \\ndisposed to landfill. As the demand for consumer and c ommercial products containing LIB continues \\nto increase through the forecasted growth in EV sales and the adoption of grid and off -grid energy \\nstorage technology, Australia has an increasing social and ethical responsibility to manage LIB \\nwastes locally, a nd an environmental obligation to divert these wastes from landfill , and to recover \\nand reuse  the materials appropriately.  \\nThere are significant economic drivers to support the development of an industry surrounding the \\nrecovery and reuse  of valuable mate rials such a s metals  (e.g. cobalt, lithium, nickel,  and  zinc) , \\ngraphite and plastics. In addition, LIB wastes are in the process of being banned from landfill in some \\nAustralian s tates . If a product stewardship scheme i s implemented  in Australia , these two  factors  \\nwill positively  impact on the number of batteries collected and requiring further processing. \\nHowever, the development of consumer awareness programs for LIB recycling, collection of data \\nregarding generation and fate of LIB wastes, and standards and protocols surrounding the \\ncollection, transport, handling and discharge of LIB  are key challenges for the industry.  \\nThe participant interview sample comprised of a small number of industry stakeholders  operating \\nwith end -of-life LIB . This report  has l imitations arising from the small sample size , but the  authors \\nsupplemented the information and themes garnered from stakeholder interviews with a thorough \\ndesktop review . From the desktop review and stakeholder interviews, the following conclusions \\nregard ing the development of a local recycling industry for LIB in Australia were made.  \\nThe aim of thi s report was to bring together various academic literature and white papers that are \\nrelevant to this emerging industry. We also wanted to include the voice of  industry stakeholders in \\narticulating the challenges and opportunities for this emerging industry. We found that while there \\nare headline issues in each of the PESTLE areas, often they are inter -connected. For example, \\naddressing the social issues of LIB collection is associated with economic viability of recycling due to \\nvolumes available for recycling which is in turn connected with decisions on technical processing \\noptions. Our summary of the key points for each area is provided below.  \\nPolitical and reg ulatory drivers  \\nThe Australian policy and regulation landscape for management, product stewardship and resource \\nrecovery from LIB is developing, and each State operates their own regulatory guidance for the \\nrecycling or recovery of this waste. Some states have already commenced or are considering a \\nlandfill ban for the disposal of batteries which will result in greater numbers of LIB being diverte d \\nfrom landfill. Industry stakeholders supported the developmen t of a voluntary recycling regulatory \\nframework using proven models, such as MobileMuster , as a reference scheme. An example of an \\ninternational shipping ban  on carrying waste LIBs highlights Australia’s waste management \\n52   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  exposure to factors beyond our cont rol,  and this example has similarities to the China waste ban. \\nThis is a driver for Australia to manage waste streams  domestically . There is also potential for \\nAustralia to act as an Asia -Pacific recycling hub , with opportunities  for importing waste from \\nregional neighbours such as New Zealand.   \\nEconomic considerations  \\nThere are considerable economic drivers supporting the development of a local recycling industry \\nfor LIB in Australia, largely driven by the value of materials that could be recovered (metal s, plastics \\nand graphite), as well as the current cost of waste export to the international market. The current \\ncollection of LIB waste is too low to support a local recycling industry for LIB, but forecasting showed \\nthat sufficient volumes will be generat ed in the near future ( ca. 2036) and that this represents a \\nsignificant opportunity for the Australian economy. However, there are significant gaps in data \\nsurrounding waste generation, fate and materials tracking and further consideration of the \\neconomic impacts of collection, transport, dismantling and pre -processing of battery wastes is still \\nrequired. In addition, as the industry is currently very small, there is a need for further investme nt \\nin research and development to shape the Australian industry.  \\nSocial considerations  \\nOne of the key barriers to the development of a local recycling industry for LIB is the lack of \\nconsumer awareness surrounding the environmental and human health and safety risks associated \\nwith improper handling, storage and disposa l of LIB. In addition, the education of the consumer \\nregarding the recycling and recovery of resources from these wastes would assist with improving \\ncollection rates, and also the sorting of materials prior to recycling. The role of the consumer is \\nparamou nt in the development of this industry, and consumer education processes could be \\nmodelled on MobileMuster , as a best practice method for improving social awareness of LIB \\nrecycling. It was widely accepted by stakeholders that Australia has an obligation  to process wastes \\nlocally, and this was a key driver to the development of the industry.  \\nTechnical factors  \\nThis study showed that there are a number of existing options for the  processing and recovery of \\nvalue from LIB waste that are available for further research and development in Australia. These \\nprocesses are typically driven by the recovery of cobalt , other metals and technical materials  with \\nadditional economic value from  lithium  recovery , and some further consideration regarding the \\nimpact of changin g battery chemistries on these processes is required. In addition, further \\ninvestigation is recommended  into the reuse  and re -manufacture of LIB, prior to disposal. There are \\nsignificant technical challenges still required to be addressed for recycling pro cesses to be efficient \\nand these include (but are not limited to) the development of standardised protocols for  labelling, \\ndismantling and discharging  batteries  in order to promote efficient and safe sorting at the front end \\nof the recycling process. The p otential of mobile processing options was supported.  \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  53 Environmental  issues  \\nThe environmental implications associated with the improper handling and disposal of LIB waste \\nwas well -characterised in the literature and well -understood by the stakeholders engage d in this \\nstudy. The stakeholders identified that consumer awareness related to this was lacking, and could \\nbe improved to support diversion from landfill and the development of the industry.  \\n \\n15.2   Key Findings  \\nThere is significant  potential for targeted research to help realise Australia’s opportunity to extract \\nvalue from LIB waste. The Australian research community, in partnership with industry and \\ngovernments can play a role in realising this opportunity and catalysing a new ind ustry which in turn \\ncreates new jobs for Australia . Through the thorough desktop review and engagement of LIB battery \\nrecycling  stakeholders , the following observations  can be made to support the development of a \\ndomestic  recycling industry in Australia.  \\nKey Finding 1: Dedicated product stewardship programs and c onsumer  education drives  \\nrecycling and resource recovery from LIB  \\nThe lack of an appropriate product stewardship program and consumer awareness regarding \\nrecycling options for LIB are key issues th at must be addressed in order to increase Australia’s LIB \\ncollection rate . The current low collection rate of 2 % is reportedly limiting confidence and \\ninvestment by industry into recycling infrastructure. General waste collection, transfer and \\nmanagement costs in Australia are costly due to large freighting distances between major \\npopulation centres, without the additional impact of segregation of specialised waste streams such \\nas LIB wastes. Introduction of a product stewardship scheme would enable rapid expansion and \\ninvestment required for an expanding waste stream. Simultaneously, a targeted  consumer \\nawareness  campaign  and education program would  help support investment in  recycling processes \\nand technology . Included in a consumer awareness campaign is to advertise existing collection sites \\nand work towards new collection points by working with a range of OEMs, retailers and recyclers. \\nBest practice recycling consumer guides for a range of key product ranges, such as handheld LIB, \\nhousehold energy storag e products and EVs, would also support this effort.  An education campaign \\nalso supports existing and potential future State and Territory battery landfill bans.  \\nKey Finding 2: A safe and successful LIB recycling industry can be developed by addressing \\ncritical information gaps  \\nParticipants reported industry information gaps in best practice guides for standards regulating \\nreuse of LIB, end -of-life transport, and recycling of LIB. Desirable information to support a successful \\nindustry included economic mode lling, life cycle assessment for LIB reuse and recycling technology \\nassessments. The collection of this information will support the safe development of an Australian \\nLIB processing and recycling industry.  \\n54   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  Key Finding 3: A need to identify technology proc essing  options for the Australian context  \\nInvestment into recycling technology suitable for Australian conditions takes a modern approach to \\nrecycling. This requires the right technology and business models for an Australian context. \\nAustralia’s distribute d population is suitable for potential  deployment of mobile processing \\ntechnology . Alternatively, large scale LIB processing could also be feasible if key information and \\ndata gaps and economic modelling can be addressed. There would be a number of technic al \\nchallenges that would require further research and development for both options, and this creates \\nthe potential for the development of innovative technology for the Australian LIB recycling industry . \\nParticipants suggested Australia has the potential to  become a  recycling  hub with feedstock sourced \\nfrom neighbouring countries such as New Zealand . This would further secure supply, improve \\neconomic feasibility and supports either large -scale or small -scale processing options.  \\nKey Finding 4: An onshore, loc al LIB recycling industry is economically and environmentally \\nachievable  \\nThere are strong economic and environmental drivers for Australia to manage LIB waste onshore. \\nIn this context, dedicated policies, regulations, standards and certifications relating to LIB and their \\nwaste will support technology development and industry investment in LIB recycling. Australia can \\nview international examples such as those in the European Union and see how their existing policies,  \\nregulations and resource recovery target s have driven innovation and technology development. \\nFrom this, appropriate changes can be made to provide maximum support for the Australian battery \\nrecycling landscape.  \\nKey Finding 5: Creation of standards and industry best practice guides for LIB recyc ling  \\nDedicated s tandards surrounding labelling, safety, transport, discharge and processing were \\nidentified by stakeholders as key drivers for the success of the industry.  Current standards need to \\nbe modified where applicable to cover LIB recycling and wh ere required new standards would need \\nto be written and adopted. In the interim, industry best practice guides will enable the industry to  \\nadopt new or modified standards and create a smoother transition to a new safe and \\nenvironmentally sound LIB recyclin g process.  \\n15.3   What is CSIRO doing in the area of LIB recycling?  \\nUnderstanding that a potential need for recycling solutions will be required in the near future , CSIRO \\nis currently exploring a number of Research Areas to provide the science needed for LIB rec ycling.  \\nResearch Area: Development of technical processes for recovery of metals and other \\nmaterials from LIB waste  \\nCSIRO is investigating the recovery of valuable secondary resources, such as cobalt, lithium and \\ngraphite from LIB wastes. These resources would otherwise be exported and lost from the \\nAustralian economy  or lost to landfill. The research is focussed on the development of a whole  \\nprocess  approach , which encompasses : \\nLithium battery recycling in Australia   |  55 \\uf0b7 Preparation and characterisation of the wastes ; \\n\\uf0b7 Metal solubilisation and mater ials recovery ; and,  \\n\\uf0b7 Techno -economic assessment of process feasibility.  \\nIn addition, research  also being conducted is  targeted a t defining data associated with:  \\n\\uf0b7 LIB waste generation ;  \\n\\uf0b7 Materials tracking and costs associated with collection ;  \\n\\uf0b7 Transport;   \\n\\uf0b7 Manual handling and sorting of the waste prior to processing ; and ,  \\n\\uf0b7 Inconsistent feedstocks and low volumes of waste .  \\nThese are all significant bottlenecks that need to be addressed for the development of battery \\nrecycling processes . CSIRO is also investig ating alternative materials and resource recovery for \\nbatteries which do not contain cobalt or have low cobalt quantity with a view to ensure that the \\nrecovery process produces materials which are still high value to ensure these alternative LIB have \\nan ec onomic recycling process.  \\nResearch Area: The circular economy  \\nCSIRO also has a project aimed at supporting the circular economy and reuse and recycling of \\ncommercial and industrial waste resources.  ASPIRE (Advisory System for Processing, Innovation & \\nRes ource Exchange) was originally developed by CSIRO with four Melbourne municipalities. The \\nproject was led by the City of Kingston. ASPIRE is a project aimed at connecting businesses where \\nwaste or by -products from one company can be used at another. This i s known as industrial \\nsymbiosis and ASPIRE has been successfully deployed in Victoria (King et al. 2016) . \\nASPIRE is a digital tool that also supports a social business network. It extends beyond passive was te \\nexchange systems, where information is posted by ‘sellers’ online for potential ‘buyers’. ASPIRE then \\ngoes one step further to create a matchmaking marketplace by actively suggesting business to \\nbusiness collaborations. ASPIRE has been developed in response to manu facturing companies \\ntalking to their local councils about waste disposal costs.  \\nFor more information: https://research.csiro.au/aspire  \\nResearch Area: Development of novel battery materials  \\nCSIRO is investig ating  the development of new battery materials such as sulfur cathodes as well as \\nevaluation of next generation batteries. Using the knowledge gained from these activities, CSIRO is \\ndetermining the impact on recycling  processes if cobalt and nickel are rem oved. This data will feed \\ninto the development of technical processes for battery recycling, with the goal of developing a \\nrecycling process that is flexible, and not dependent on a single LIB chemistry type  and enables \\neconomic value to still be extracted . CSIRO is also developing a range of technologies which could \\nprovide valuable new manufacturing outputs  for recycled products recovered from LIB, and  thereby \\npotentially providing recyclers with greater  economic incentives for recycling.   \\n56   |  Lithium battery recycling in Australia  References   \\nAAS, 2017.
