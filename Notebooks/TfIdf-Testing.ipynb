Compared to the traditionally used lead acid batteries, the weight saving is roughly 70%. Other advantages of lithium ion batteries compared to lead acid, are the higher storage capacity (4 times higher), longer lifetime and near-zero maintenance potential. \\n\\n Another major reason for the transition to Li-ion batteries in the marine, is that the technology contributes to greener shipping. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimated that the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from shipping represented 2.2% of the global human-made emmissions in 2012. They expect this number to increase to rise to 50 – 250% by 2050 if no action is taken.   \\n\\n An increasing use of Lithium ion batteries leads to an increased risk for fire. In a report made by the European Union, scientists conclude that   This is because a lithium-ion battery fire is one of the most dangerous and difficult fires to control and extinguish. The authors of the European Union point out that traditional fire surpressor systems are not effective in case of a battery fire. In fact, a surpression system would even worsen the situation. \\n\\n The safety approach for batteries on sea is different than on land. The hull of a vessel gets slammed with waves, sometimes at very high frequency when the weather is rough. The shock and vibration effects can eventually lead to structural damage of the battery encasing, potentially triggering short-circuit. And above all, it takes much more time for the emergency services to reach a burning ship. \\n \\n For smaller vessels (2 to 24 metres), Li-ion technogy has already replaced a lot of combustion engines and lead acid batteries for electrically powered boats. Also for recreational boats the batteries become more popular. Niche markets such as yachts, watercraft, drones and underwater vehicles will eventually also swift to lithium batteries. Despite the still relatively limited use in the marine today, a number of battery fire incidents on sea have been reported. And a lot of fire incidents go unreported since the fire destroys the evidence, the resarchers of the EU Union say.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n   \\n On July 1, a secretive Russian AC-31 (Project 10831) nuclear-powered submersible suffered a deadly onboard fire and explosion while operating underwater in the Barents Sea. 14 officers were killed because of the high concentration of poisonous smoke inside the compartment.  \\nOnly July 4rd, the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin the fatal fire happened in the electric battery compartment of the submersible. \\n\\n \\nNuclear-powered submarines use rechargeable batteries as backups—mostly traditional lead-acid ones that were used by submariners for more than a century. But the Losharik apparently has a more modern lithium-ion battery, like ones ubiquitous in mobile phones. than previously known. The newspaper reported that the cause of the fire was an electrical short circuit that occurred while the Losharik was docking with its mothership, Podmoskovye, which led to a heat dissipation of the lithium-ion battery, which subsequently exploded and went up in flames.\\n \\nOn September 7th 2018 a fire occurred in the garage of the superyacht My Kanga, at that time at anchor in the coastal area of Croatia. The fire quickly developed to the upper decks resulting in an uncontrollable situation. It took less than 25 minutes for the fire to spread to the sun deck, accompanied by explosions. Orders were given to abandon the ship. The safety investigation that was published in 2019 concluded that the fire in all probability was caused by the lithium batteries of an electric surfboard. The crew was not aware of the fact how dangerous lithium batteries can be. According to  this article published by SuperYachtNews.com , 55 superyacht fires have been reported since 2000. This represents 1% of the total deliveries. Considering the private nature of this market, this number should actually be significantly higher. \\n\\n \\n For safely storing and charging lithium batteries used for electric surfboards we recommend our custom made  LithiumSafe Battery Box . For portable electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones, our fire proof  LithiumSafe Battery Bag  is the ideal solution. \\n\\n\\n Recommended products: LithiumSafe™ Battery Box  \\n LithiumSafe™ Battery Bag  \\n LithiumSafe™ Separator  \\n \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\n\\t \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t \\n\\t \\r\\n \\r\\n+31 (0)180 20 11 42 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nsupport@lithiumsafe.com\\r\\n \\r\\n \\n\\r\\n Koopvaardijweg 3A 4906 CV Oosterhout The Netherlands \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t© 2022 LithiumSafe.

It\\'s electricity. An electrical impulse spawned deep in the sinoatrial node spurs the heart to beat. It\\'s the means by which the brain communicates and contemplates, allowing you to read and comprehend this sentence. Even the most guileless of flowers generates electricity to communicate with bees for life-giving pollination. Without it they, and we, are nothing. The same goes for your boat. A world without watts is one of mute motors, lifeless lighting and defrosted fridges. Bilge pumps rendered impotent as bricks; depth sounders powerless to warn of shallows; GPS sets saying \"GeePerS, we\\'re lost!\" No windlass, no thruster, no radio to issue a distress call. You are, effectively, all at sea in the modern marine vessel. So a battery deserves love and attention, care and affection... not total disregard. But very few boat owners are \\'switched on\\', so to speak, until they\\'re switched off and plunged into doom and darkness. Perhaps we\\'re blase because the technology is two centuries old, when Alessandro Volta hypothesised that electricity was generated when two dissimilar metals met a moist intermediary. Today, though, there are numerous battery types to suit specific roles, priced from the tens to ten thousands of dollars. Yes, they come in the same ubiquitous oblong case, they all deliver the same quantity of volts, but there\\'s a stark difference in construction. First commandment The first commandment of marine battery maintenance is: \"Thou shalt not covet thy car battery\", for it won\\'t cope with the harsh vibration dispensed by the marine environment. Cheap is nasty in a marine context. That said, expensive isn\\'t necessarily best, either. There\\'s a quality variance between popular battery makes, according to the experts, with specialist stores generally only supplying and supporting five or six of the 30-odd brands commonly available. If in doubt, ask for the impartial advice of a qualified marine electrician. The second commandment warns: \"All batteries art dangerous. \"The sulphuric acid (electrolyte) contained within a lead battery is corrosive, causing skin and respiratory irritation, eye damage... even tooth enamel erosion. Hydrogen is emitted from lead acid batteries during charging, while a battery immersed in saltwater can create a toxic chlorine gas that\\'s harmful to the airways, eyes and skin. Lithium-ion batteries - the new kids on the block - also have a fiery past, although the use of smart control systems to monitor their temperature and regulate their charging has yielded major improvements. Lithium contains sodium and potassium, both highly reactive. Internal damage can lead to a short circuit, triggering a \\'thermal runaway\\' that may lead to combustion. The other critical issue is to charge them within a safe limit. To avoid sparking, disconnect the negative battery cable first and reconnect it last. Loose battery connections can ignite flammable fumes so make sure they\\'re tight. Also, remove your jewellery before working on a battery because a short-circuit current can \\'weld\\' a ring or bracelet and induce severe burns. Maintenance tools can be insulated with layers of electrical tape and it pays to place rubber boots on cable connections in case a tool contacts a terminal. For the same reason, use a plastic brush instead of wire bristles when cleaning terminals. Explosive Marine sparkies, like Rohan Collibee, at Lake Macquarie Marine Electrical in NSW, don\\'t take chances: \"Lead acid batteries start to vent quite violently when they are being overcharged - put a spark in that environment and, bang, yes it will explode,\" he says. \"When I climb into a pleasureboat I let the bilge ventilate for a few minutes and make sure everything is isolated. Battery compartments should always be vented outside the hull.\" The lament of Clive Weatherhead, from Sydney-based supplier, Battery Business is that battery placement is often ill-considered by naval architects. \"I just wish boat designers would change a few batteries themselves because they wouldn\\'t locate them in the places they do,\" he says. \"When I die and go to heaven I intend to meet every boat designer I can find and spend some time chatting with them.\" Ideally, trailercraft batteries should be located high enough so that they are unlikely to ever come in contact with saltwater. Portability becomes a weighty concern when considering safe lifting limits. With single 200-amp batteries weighing up to 70kg, two 100-amp batteries connected in parallel can be a preferred option and will improve handling and placement flexibility. For boats over 35 feet, 24-volt systems are an option - either two 12s or four 6-volt batteries rigged in series (positive to negative). By doubling the volts you halve the current required, enabling smaller cabling to be run. Remember, series gives more volts for the same amps, parallel gives more amps for the same volts. With windlasses and thrusters it\\'s recommended that a separate battery be housed nearby, with some hefty cabling. It pays to parallel in with the house system through a good solenoid because the last thing you want is for the thruster to fail. Ample amps Some basic math is also needed to calculate your DC system\\'s draw, with energy being measured in ampere hours (AH). The equation for two lights that draw 1.5 amps for five hours is simply: 2 x 1.5 x 5 = 15AH. You can do the same with watt hours, dividing by 12 to calculate amp hours. For vessels with AC power running through an inverter, the conversion formula is AC watts x hours/10 = AH/day. Compile a list of all the electrical components on your boat, calculate the total consumption between charges... then treble it. In other words, if the figure is 150AH, you need a house bank capacity of 450AH. Aim to never draw more than 40 per cent of a lead battery\\'s capacity between charges. With a 200AH unit, that means drawing fewer than 80 amps on a regular basis. To give some different installation examples from Clive Weatherhead, a single battery will suffice for a 15-foot tinnie running basic electronics and lighting. If used regularly and for extended periods, though, it\\'s worth considering a second battery to supplement the starting battery. \"Most twin-battery installations have a switch, but it\\'s a good idea to add a voltage-sensitive relay between the two batteries that automates the charge when the motor starts,\" Weatherhead adds. \"It costs around $120 in parts and makes life so much easier.\" A 22-foot sterndrive runabout used once a month, on average, needs separate cranking and house batteries, the latter being at least one N200 200AH battery. On a 35ft cruising yacht with diesel propulsion and a solar panel, Weatherhead would expect to see 800AH of house battery, though some owners survive with just 600. Banks of batteries Moving up to a 50-foot sportscruiser, you\\'re in the realm of dual cranking batteries per motor and either one considerable battery bank that runs the inverter and DC house or a separate inverter bank and house bank. Bigger trawlers cart up to 20 batteries, providing 200AH each for house. A battery\\'s lifespan will suffer if you short-change on capacity. A small bank drops voltage quickly when subjected to load and the more you take out of a battery the faster it deteriorates. Most boaties want all the 240-volt luxuries of home, like air-conditioning, but Rohan Collibee and others prefer to set up boats so they don\\'t rely on generators running continuously. \"You can be more independent with solar panels and wind generators,\" he says. \"I use appliances like 12-volt televisions and 12-volt fridges where possible, and people can charge their laptops and smartphones on 12-volts these days.\" By running the boat\\'s motor(s) during high-draw situations - operating the windlass and thrusters - the alternator bolsters the battery bank. They largely run at 14.2 to 14.4 volts under charge, dropping once load is applied. Most people only replace their existing batteries when they fail or there has been a crisis such as submersion, whereas ongoing vessel usage really needs to be considered - installing new electronics or transitioning from day trips to extended stays, for example. The third commandment is: \"Batteries perform different functions and shalt be chosen accordingly.\" Those designed for cranking (starting) have thin lead plates with extra surface-area contact for the acid solution, allowing them to deliver punch fast. They don\\'t store a great deal of energy, however, being designed to discharge no more than two or three per cent before recharge. A deep-cycle battery, as favoured for house usage, sports thicker plates and stores energy that can be dispersed over a longer period. As the name suggests, they\\'re better at being deeply discharged. The compromise for smaller boats is a single hybrid battery, roughly halfway between starting and cycling, and generally kept fully charged. From there you move into the different types. Bargain basement is the traditional \\'wet\\' lead acid type that requires maintenance. They\\'re absolutely fine for the serious boatie, who goes out often and is prepared to check electrolyte levels every few weeks, topping them up when needed. If that\\'s not you, consider a maintenance-free sealed battery with more acid covering the plates. Over several years that acid will evaporate, so they need more fluid to begin with. More advanced again is an AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat) battery, which is sealed, but has plates separated by matting that absorbs acid. An AGM can be inverted in the event of a yacht capsize or lain on its side. Most racing yachts require them under regulations, but they should be mandatory for all large cruising vessels, too. The initial cost disadvantage of 30 to 40 per cent above a wet battery is vastly offset by the longevity. The design life on a good AGM will be eight to 10 years; roughly twice that of a maintenance-free battery. Deep cycling capability and shock resistance are also enhanced. Next up are gel batteries, in which the acid in the glass mat is replaced with a liquid gel that\\'s pumped into the battery and left to set. They\\'re more expensive to make and buy, are heavier, and are typically better for deep cycling than cranking. Lithium-ions are the pinnacle, offering a substantial (up to 70 per cent) weight and space saving, but adding complexity and cost, at least initially. They have three times the lifespan of traditional batteries and boast ultra-fast charging and discharging - down to 20 per cent and up to 100 per cent. Care and feeding A good battery monitor is essential to determine battery health. A 12-volt system should be sitting at 12.8 volts or above when idle, and if you get an inexplicable change in voltage - even to just 12.4 - the alarm bells should sound. One crook battery can cannibalise the good batteries in a bank, as the charger will innocently try to force all of the batteries to get to 14.4 volts - with one out of action its mates will rapidly be gassed off. Also, when not under charge, the good batteries attempt to compensate for the weak link and their voltage drops dramatically. A battery has a \\'memory\\', of sorts, in that it will \\'sulphate\\' if not cycled. Once sulphated, it will produce resistance and confuse the charger into thinking it\\'s full, yet when the battery is subjected to load it soon collapses. How often do your hear that a power vessel got to a fishing spot then wouldn\\'t start again? Sadly you can\\'t clutch-start or call roadside services, although emergency \\'jump-start\\' products are available. Sometimes it\\'s because the alternator isn\\'t charging the battery, so it\\'s always best to have a voltmeter installed so you always know it\\'s charging properly. Ideally it should read in the high 13s or just over 14 when running. Another reason is that boaties run livewells off the cranking battery, unaware that a pump can draw 13 amps or more, which will flatten a starting battery in hours. That\\'s why it\\'s worth having a separate deep-cycle battery. With a battery switch you should run initially on \\'1\\' then switch to \\'Both\\'. When you shut down the motor, switch to \\'2\\' and stay on that. Battery 1 will thus be peachy keen when you restart. Opinion is divided on whether you can or should use the battery switch when the engine is running. If in doubt, only switch over when the engine is stopped. Wind and sun Moored boats are most at risk of flat batteries due to inadequate charging. A combination of solar and wind generation covers all the bases when you\\'re away from shore power. Some boats use solar for the 12-volt bank and wind for the 24-volt bank. Hard-wired bilge pumps operate even when the switches are off and electrical systems are often plagued by phantom current drains as well. Lead acid batteries also have a tendency to drain themselves, more so than lithium-ion, over time. If batteries haven\\'t been kept fully charged over winter, then do so immediately, ensuring they come up to full voltage in reasonable time. Left to sit after being exhausted, the battery risks being irreparably damaged. The current thinking (\\'scuse the pun) is that your deep-cycle charger should be able to produce 20 per cent of your battery\\'s capacity in charge output per hour; it used to be 10 per cent. A charger must have an appropriate algorithm for the battery type, since some can be overly brutal. Reconditioning is possible if the battery isn\\'t too badly sulphated. It undergoes a 24-36 hour desulphation program then is subjected to a specialised charge. If a battery has dropped a cell, there\\'s nothing that can be done. Disposal must be performed by an EPA-approved recycler. Most battery suppliers offer a free drop-off service - Battery Business, for example, recycles two tonnes a week, with around 97 per cent of battery components being recycled. Cost of charge AGM batteries are recommended as the minimum for most marine applications, and a rudimentary Google search shows a generic 12-volt 200AH AGM deep-cycle battery selling for as little as $350, but these are generally lower quality and we\\'re advised that quality units carry much higher prices. With a 200AH Lithium-ion costing $2800 or more, it appears a hard argument to make. But when you consider the relative costs compared to capacity (usable amp hours) - along with greater longevity and potentially a reduction in fuel consumption from a generator - the balance can tip towards the latter. Whichever way you go, get your mix of batteries right and you\\'ll have years of service from your power source. Get it wrong and, frankly, it\\'s lights out.  Do\\'s and don\\'ts * Make sure your batteries are securely tied down with strong straps and saddles * Keep battery terminals and connections greased to prevent corrosion. Make sure you tighten all bolts to cables * Use hot water to clean any acid spills away from the top of the battery, which can otherwise cause discharge * Don\\'t mix battery types as they charge at different rates. Replace like-for-like or the entire bank * If a battery fails in a big bank of batteries, replacing only one can cause it to age and quickly deteriorate to the same condition as the rest of the bank. As a rule, it is preferable to replace the whole bank at the same time * Lead acid batteries prefer temperatures around 25 degrees C and their capacity plummets as the mercury drops below 15 degrees.

A routine inspection at least once a month is recommended to maintain optimum performance. \\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Your Marine battery prefers to be kept fully charged when not in use, at a voltage of 12.5v or above. If a battery is left in a partially discharged or flat state for extended periods of time, irreversable internal damage will gradually begin to occur, greatly reducing the overall service life you will get out of it. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Ensure the top of your Marine battery remains\\xa0clean, dry, free of dirt and grime. A dirty battery may begin to lose it\\'s charge faster, as an\\xa0electrical current may travel across the grime on top of the battery casing.\\xa0Inspect the battery case for obvious signs of physical damage or warpage. This usually indicates the battery has been overheated or has been overcharged. \\r\\n \\r\\nIf you have a maintainable battery (with removable caps on top)\\xa0it is important to check if the battery has sufficient electrolyte (water) inside to cover\\xa0the battery plates. If topping up is required, use\\xa0distilled or demineralised water only.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n Battery CHARGING \\r\\n\\r\\n After use, your Marine battery should be recharged using a proper multi-stage battery charger.\\xa0Lead acid batteries should be charged in 3 stages; constant current (boost), constant voltage (absorption) and float charge. \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n There are many different chargers on the market with varying amp ratings - so make sure you use the following steps to determinte which battery charger is right for your battery. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Before attempting to charge a battery with an external battery charger, it is important to be aware of the safety precautions when charging batteries and follow the instructions outlined by the charger manufacturer. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Dangerous explosive gases are generated during the charging process that can be ignited by a variety of sources including, sparks, naked flames and static electricity. It is highly recommended to wear PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) including safety glasses, chemical resistant gloves and overalls. \\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n HOW TO INSTALL A BATTERY \\r\\n\\r\\n Before removing or installing a battery\\xa0ensure that all electrical equipment within the vehicle is turned off, including the ignition system, air-conditioning, lights and radio. \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Before removing the old or existing battery from your vehicle, take note of the   and   terminals on the battery, and ensure that your replacement battery is of the same type and terminal layout. \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Ensure your vehicle\\'s ignition system is \"off\" before installing your new Marine\\xa0battery. \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\xa0 \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS \\r\\n\\r\\n Below is a list of frequently asked questions: \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n There can be many reasons why a battery has gone flat, but it is usually due to: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n If you\\'ve recently experienced a flat battery, it is important to have your battery retailer investigate whether any problems exist with the vehicle\\'s charging system before a new battery is fitted. \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Simply going for a drive will not provide enough charge to recharge a flat battery. Vehicle charging systems are designed to provide a \\'surface charge\\'\\xa0which is sufficient to maintain a healthy battery, but nowhere near enough to bring a flat battery back from the dead. The only way to recharge a flat battery is to use a proper multi-stage battery charger, with an amp rating high enough to restore the battery to peak performance. \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Almost all batteries have a natural tendency to go flat over time, especially when they\\'re not in use. If you\\'ve got an old mobile phone stored in a draw at home, you\\'ll notice it\\'ll probably be flat the next time to try to turn it on - and it\\'s the same story with your Marine\\xa0battery. For batteries that are rarely used, it\\'s important to test and charge them regularly to prevent them from self-discharging and going flat. \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Lead-acid batteries last 42 months on average - however this figure may be reduced or extended\\xa0depending on a number of factors, including: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n No. While tap water might be easy to source, adding it to your maintainable battery is not a great idea unless you are in an emergency situation. Tap water contains minerals which will accelerate\\xa0corrosion - reducing the performance and life of the battery. Always use distilled or demineralised water to top up maintainable batteries. \\r\\n\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Yes!

Your reference number is  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Batteries are a vital element on a boat, yet they’re often neglected — right up until the moment they stop working. Suddenly the lighting, bilge pump, electronics and engine starting system won’t work. You’re stuck, hopefully not in the middle of the bay. What do you do now? \\n \\n The key to preventing battery failure is to look after them. Here are five of the most common ways that marine batteries meet their end — and how to avoid them. \\n 1) Use the wrong kind of battery \\n The surest way to quickly kill a marine battery is to use the wrong kind. Marine batteries are manufactured in a variety of types and for different applications, so choosing the right one is vital. \\n Due to their lower cost, the most common type of marine batteries are the flooded lead acid type (e.g. wet cell batteries). There are also gel batteries, Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) batteries and spiral-wound battery derivatives; and lithium-ion marine batteries, although they tend to be more expensive. \\n Marine batteries are made to meet two applications. Starting batteries, also known as cranking batteries, provide a large jolt of amperes. As the names implies, they are typically used to start a marine engine and are built to recharge quickly. \\n Deep cycle batteries are designed to provide fewer amperes but are intended to operate for longer. They run the various electronics components on a boat and are meant to recharge more slowly. ‘Pure’ deep cycle batteries aren’t designed to be fully discharged. Instead, they have an ideal operating range (typically around 60 per cent) and shouldn’t be discharged below this level. \\n Dual-purpose batteries are also very common. Sometimes referred to as just marine batteries, they provide a balance between starting and deep cycle use. \\n A cranking battery repeatedly used for deep cycling can degrade in a matter of weeks, and vice versa, so choose the right one. \\n 2) Overcharge and undercharge \\n Batteries need to be properly maintained in order to last. Essential to marine battery maintenance is proper charging so always use a charger that meets the manufacturer’s recommendations. \\n Regularly under-charging a battery erodes its performance and reduces its life due to a phenomenon called sulfation. This occurs when lead sulfate crystals form on the negative plates, impeding performance and reducing the battery’s ability to charge. Eventually this can render it unusable. \\n Excessive or incorrect overcharging can be equally damaging, particularly with AGM and gel batteries. Doing so can ‘cook’ a battery so it is essential to follow the manufacturer’s charging recommendations. \\n Thankfully, many readily available tools and accessories are available to keep your batteries in running order. For example, charging and maintaining a battery over long idle periods (like winter) using a multistage charger like SmartCharge\\xa0will prolong its life. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 3) Don’t maintain your battery \\n Marine battery maintenance means more than regular charging. Neglecting other forms of maintenance can also lead to deterioration. \\n Water loss, due to evaporation from heat and other chemical reactions, is common in wet cell batteries. It can rapidly shorten a wet cell battery’s life if left unchecked, so ensure the water level remains topped up (but not to overflowing). Only use distilled water, as impurities in tap water will accumulate inside the battery. Note that deep cycle batteries tend to lose water faster than starters. \\n External components should also be inspected. Check that the lead posts don’t show signs of coming off (they can be weekend if a terminal was forcefully connected). A gentle dose of grease, lanolin or Vaseline can stave off corrosion on exposed metal terminals. Once a year, clean out the battery box, check for signs of leaks and corrosion, check the vent is clear, and inspect the tie-downs. \\n 4) Place the battery in the wrong spot \\n Marine batteries differ to car batteries in that they are meant to operate in an environment that will be subjected to strong vibrations. \\n Even so, a poorly installed setup can suffer from excessive vibrations, which in turn loosens the internal workings, eventually weakening the battery. \\n The battery box (especially on smaller boats) should be located where it won’t be adversely affected by wave pounding and engine vibrations. It should also be situated in a location where it won’t get flooded by seawater. Wet call batteries should also be situated in a location with adequate ventilation. \\n 5) Buy the cheapest possible marine battery \\n As with so many things in life, you get what you pay for with boat batteries. As mentioned, marine batteries need to fulfil several functions so the temptation may be to buy an automotive battery. While not contrary to any regulations, using a battery that is less likely to resist vibrations or which can’t handle steep discharge cycles puts you at risk. \\n Purchasing a second-hand battery is generally inadvisable. You don’t know its history and it’s probably not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. \\n Which battery is right for you? \\n RACV Marine has a range of batteries to suit your boat or yacht. The mobile battery team can even deliver a new battery to your home, the boat ramp, or even straight to your docked boat in Melbourne or in Geelong.

Although newer marine batteries have many features to improve safety, all batteries still rely on a chemical reaction between two dissimilar metals to store power. This reaction can be dangerous if the battery is used improperly. \\r\\n Always be sure to follow all of the precautionary warnings included with your battery such as: \\r\\n \\r\\n It is also essential to follow all the instructions and take proper safety precautions when testing a marine battery. Whether you are taking a load test, open circuit voltage test or reading the specific gravity of the electrolyte, make sure to adhere to all the safety or operational instructions that were included with that particular tester. \\r\\n One of the biggest safety hazards associated with any battery use is improper charging. Not only can it be dangerous, but it can significantly shorten battery life if done incorrectly.

On August 19, 2021, a container illegally loaded with discarded lithium batteries caught fire while enroute to the Port of Virginia. The container was being transported on a chassis from Raleigh, NC, intended for a maritime voyage to a port in China via a foreign-flagged container ship.The batteries caught fire on the highway resulting in loss of the cargo, and significant damage to the shipping container. Upon initial investigation, the responding fire department determined that the heat produced from the fire burned hot enough to create a hole through the metal container’s structure. In addition, the bill of lading listed “computer parts,” not lithium batteries. This is a situation that made responding to the fire more challenging and could have been potentially catastrophic had the container caught fire after being loaded aboard the container ship.\\xa0 Further investigation by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) determined that the shipper failed to properly placard, label, mark and package the lithium batteries, class 9, UN 3480 and 3481, and identified the cause of fire to be residual charge/full circuit, which led to a thermal increase.\\xa0 Further investigation by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) determined that the shipper failed to properly placard, label, mark and package the lithium batteries, class 9, UN 3480 and 3481, and identified the cause of fire to be residual charge/full circuit, which led to a thermal increase.\\xa0 The Coast Guard seeks to increase awareness of these hazards, and\\xa0 units and other stakeholders:\\xa0 Lithium Battery Guide for Shippers Used Lithium-Ion Batteries Field personnel should be on alert for these shipments and engage port stakeholders as appropriate to ensure compliance with all applicable standards and safe shipping conditions. In the event local units respond to a container fire\\xa0 the container reaches a port or facility, the unit should contact PHMSA and/ or the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Association (FMCSA) local representatives to handle the investigation into the incident.\\xa0 This safety alert is provided for informational purposes only and doesnotrelieveanydomesticorinternational safety, operational, or material requirements.

In light of this article, and its call to\\xa0raise\\xa0the awareness amongst crew of the risks associated with the storage and charging of electric tenders and toys in the marine environment, it is perhaps pertinent to look back at\\xa0the fire on board 40m M/Y   in 2018, which\\xa0was subsequently linked to lithium-ion batteries.\\xa0 \\r\\n As Transport Malta’s Marine Safety Investigation Unit explains in its safety investigation report into the incident,   was at anchor in the coastal area of Dubrovnik, Croatia on the morning of 7 September, 2018. While the first officer was on the bridge, the fire panel gave off an alarm, indicating a fire in the garage. \\r\\n “He immediately went down to inspect and was overwhelmed by the presence of heat and smoke in the garage,” the report states. “The main fire alarm was triggered and the first officer called all crew and passengers to muster at the bow. An attempt was made to fight the fire; however, it was unsuccessful. The fire rose towards the upper decks and subsequently grew out of control. The yacht was abandoned on orders given by the master. No injuries were reported.”\\xa0 \\r\\n “The safety investigation report concluded that, in all probability, the seat of the fire was the lithium-ion batteries...” \\r\\n The safety investigation report concluded that, in all probability, the seat of the fire was the lithium-ion batteries –   had on board a total of four lithium-ion battery packs for the electric surfboards. “Documentary evidence indicated that the crew had been experiencing some problems with the batteries of the electric surfboards, namely sea water leakage into three of the four battery packs… and had notified the manufacturers that they had intended to return them for repair/replacement,” the report reads. \\r\\n “Although the seat of the fire in the garage of   was not established, the potential sources of fire, as identified earlier in this safety investigation report, and the fittings that were provided for the fire protection of the garage, drew the attention of the investigation towards the leaking battery packs of electric surfboards.”\\xa0 \\r\\n The purpose of the marine safety investigation is to determine the circumstances and safety factors of the accident as a basis for making recommendations, and to prevent further marine casualties or incidents from occurring in the future. As such, the report ends with certain recommendations to the yacht’s managing company, designed to ensure adequate fire-detection measures, and to flag state administration, with the aim of enhancing fire safety on board commercial yachts. \\r\\n One of the conclusions made in the report was\\xa0that the\\xa0crew did not seem fully aware of the hazards associated with lithium-ion batteries, which resulted in an inadequate assessment of the risks involved with these batteries, even after three of the four batteries were found leaking. Read the aforementioned article  here  to find out more about the issue from a classification society perspective. \\r\\n To read the safety investigation report in full,  click here . \\t\\t\\t\\t

If the container is damaged, inhalation\\nmay result in mucous membrane irritation of the respiratory tract, coughing and inflammation. High level\\nexposure may result in ulceration of the respiratory tract and lung tissue damage.STOT - single\\nexposure\\nDue to product encapsulation, the potential for exposure to the contents is reduced. Lead is a cumulative\\npoison and may be absorbed into the body through ingestion or inhalation. Lead has been documented in\\nobservational human studies to produce toxicity in multiple organ systems and body function including the\\nhaematopoietic (blood) system, kidney function, reproductive function and the central nervous system.STOT - repeated\\nexposureDue to product encapsulation, the potential for exposure to the contents is reduced. Exposure to high levels\\nof lead and its compounds may cause adverse effects on male and female fertility, including adverse effects\\non sperm quality. Prenatal exposure to lead and its compounds is also associated with adverse effects on\\nneurobehavioral development in children.ReproductiveDue to product encapsulation, the potential for exposure to the contents is reduced. Occupational exposure\\nto strong inorganic acid mists containing sulphuric acid is classified as carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group\\n1).

OTHER INFORMATION\\nRESPIRATORS: In general the use of respirators should be limited and engineering controls\\nemployed to avoid exposure. If respiratory equipment must be worn ensure correct respirator\\nselection and training is undertaken. Remember that some respirators may be extremely\\nuncomfortable when used for long periods. The use of air powered or air supplied respirators should\\nbe considered where prolonged or repeated use is necessary.\\nACIDS: When mixing acids with water (diluting), caution must be taken as heat will be generated\\nwhich causes violent spattering. Always add a small volume of acid to a large volume of water,\\nNEVER the reverse.\\nPERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT GUIDELINES:\\nThe recommendation for protective equipment contained within this report is provided as a guide\\nonly. Factors such as form of product, method of application, working environment, quantity used,\\nproduct concentration and the availability of engineering controls should be considered before final\\nselection of personal protective equipment is made.\\nHEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE:\\nIt should be noted that the effects from exposure to this product will depend on several factors\\nincluding: form of product; frequency and duration of use; quantity used; effectiveness of control\\nmeasures; protective equipment used and method of application.
